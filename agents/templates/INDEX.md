# Templates Index (for agents)

This non-docs index lists the canonical authoring templates for CMS documentation. It is meant for agents and contributors browsing the repo, not for Docusaurus rendering.

## Feature Template
- Purpose: Structure for Features pages to be used with files in `docusaurus/docs/cms/features` (TL;DR, intro, identity card, configuration, usage) to keep content consistent and task‑oriented.
- Path: `agents/templates/feature-template.md`

## Plugin Template
- Purpose: Standard layout for plugins docs pages to be used with files in `docusaurus/docs/cms/plugins`. Includes identity details, install steps, configuration (admin UI and code), and usage tasks.
- Path: `agents/templates/plugin-template.md`

## Configuration Template
- Purpose: Clear guide for configuration topics, including location, available options, env variables, and per‑environment overrides. To be used with files in `docusaurus/docs/cms/configurations`.

## Guide Template
- Purpose: Step‑by‑step how‑to structure with prerequisites, numbered steps, and validation.

## API Template
- Purpose: Lightweight API page skeleton covering endpoints, auth, parameters, and example requests/responses. To serve as an inspiration for files in `docusaurus/docs/cms/api`

## Breaking Change Template
- Purpose: Individual breaking change page with BreakingChangeIdCard, side-by-side v4/v5 comparison, and migration notes with manual procedure. To be used with files in `docusaurus/docs/cms/migration/**/breaking-changes`.
