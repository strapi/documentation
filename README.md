If you are looking for the Strapi code, please see the [Strapi Monorepo](https://github.com/strapi/strapi). The present repository is only for the official Strapi documentation hosted at [docs.strapi.io](https://docs.strapi.io). Blog articles hosted at [strapi.io/blog](https://strapi.io/blog) and [community content](https://github.com/strapi/community-content) are not covered by the present repository either.

Strapi is a free and open-source headless CMS that delivers your content anywhere you need.

- **Keep control over your data**. With Strapi, you know where your data is stored, and you keep full control at all times.
- **Self-hosted**. You can host and scale Strapi projects the way you want. You can choose any hosting platform you want: AWS, Netlify, Heroku, a VPS, or a dedicated server. You can scale as you grow, 100% independent.
- **Database agnostic**. You can choose the database you prefer. Strapi works with SQL databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.
- **Customizable**. You can quickly build your logic by fully customizing APIs, routes, or plugins to fit your needs perfectly.

## Issues

Submitting issues help to improve the documentation.

To submit an issue:

1. Verify the issue is only with one of the Strapi documentation websites. Product-related issues, missing Strapi features, and any issues not directly related to the documentation should be directed at the main [strapi/strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) repository. Updates to blog posts found at [strapi.io/blog](https://strapi.io/blog) are also outside the scope of the present documentation repository; you can either reach the author of the blog post directly or use the [contact form](https://strapi.io/contact) on Strapi's corporate website if you have questions about blog posts.
2. Follow the issue template and fill out as much information as you can.
  
Technical questions should be asked using the following resources:

- Open a Q&A thread on our [official forum](https://forum.strapi.io).
- Engage with other community members on our [community Discord server](https://discord.strapi.io).

## Requests

Please use our [request documentation](https://github.com/strapi/documentation/issues/new?template=DOC_REQUEST.md&title%5B%5D=REQUEST) issue template. These requests will be checked by the Strapi Documentation team then transferred to another internal tool outside GitHub for priorization and subsequent actions.

## Releases

Thanks to a continuous integration/continuous delivery workflow, the Strapi documentation can be updated up to several times a day, depending on the number and frequency of contributions. Weekly snapshot [releases](https://github.com/strapi/documentation/releases) happen on Wednesdays and include a list of changes since the latest release.
