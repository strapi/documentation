Strapi is a free and open-source headless CMS delivering your content anywhere you need.

- **Keep control over your data**. With Strapi, you know where your data is stored, and you keep full control at all times.
- **Self-hosted**. You can host and scale Strapi projects the way you want. You can choose any hosting platform you want: AWS, Netlify, Heroku, a VPS, or a dedicated server. You can scale as you grow, 100% independent.
- **Database agnostic**. You can choose the database you prefer. Strapi works with SQL databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, and SQLite.
- **Customizable**. You can quickly build your logic by fully customizing APIs, routes, or plugins to fit your needs perfectly.
