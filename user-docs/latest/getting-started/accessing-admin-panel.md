# Accessing the admin panel

The admin panel is the back office of your Strapi application. From the admin panel, you will be able to manage content types, and write actual their content. It is also from the admin panel that you will manage users, both for the admin panel and your Strapi application.

To access the admin panel:

1. Launch Strapi.
2. Click on the **Open the administration** button.
3. Enter your credentials to log in.
4. Click on the **Log in** button. You should be redirected to the homepage of the admin panel.

If this is your first time accessing the admin panel, welcome to Strapi! Before going further, don't hesitate to set up your preferred language for the admin panel, using the menu in the top right-hand corner. You can also take a look at your user profile, to make sure everything is rightly set up.
