# Writing content

In Strapi, writing content consists in filling up fields, which are meant to contain specific content (e.g. text, numbers, media etc.). These fields were configured for the collection or single type beforehand, through the Content-Types Builder.

To write or edit content:

1. Access the edit view of your collection or single type.
2. Write your content, following the available field schema. You can refer to the table below for more information and instructions on how to fill up each field type.

## Collaborating on content writing

Contents created with Strapi may be edited by several admin panel users. Since these contents cannot be versioned, and to prevent any content loss, Strapi automatically informs users of concurrent edition situations.

When arriving on the edit view of a content type, if another user is already editing it, you will see the following window pop up on your screen.

[screenshot]

From there, you will be able to choose between 2 options:

- Activate the read-only mode, meaning that you will access the edit view of the content type and see its content, but you will not be able to do any action whatsoever, until the other user has finished and saved the current editing.
- Take over the editing of the page, meaning that you can edit the content type. However, the other user will see a notification pop up to inform them of your choice, and that their modifications cannot be saved.
