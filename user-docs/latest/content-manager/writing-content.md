# Writing content

In Strapi, writing content consists in filling up fields, which are meant to contain specific content (e.g. text, numbers, media etc.). These fields were configured for the collection or single type beforehand, through the Content-Types Builder.

To write or edit content:

1. Access the edit view of your collection or single type.
2. Write your content, following the available field schema. You can refer to the table below for more information and instructions on how to fill up each field type.

| Field name  | Instructions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

::: tip NOTE
For components, writing their content works exactly like for independant fields. They're only displayed as a group.
 
However, for dynamic zones, a couple steps are necessary before accessing the fields:

1. Click on the ![icon add to content](../assets/content-manager/icon_add3.png) **Add to content** button.
2. Choose a component available for the dynamic zone.
3. Fill in the fields of the component.

Note also that dynamic zones can be:

- reordered, using the arrow button ![icon reorder](../assets/content-manager/icon_reorder.png), to define in what order the components of the dynamic zone should be read or seen.
- deleted, using the trash button ![icon delete](../assets/content-manager/icon_delete3.png).

Both buttons are displayed in the top right corner of the dynamic zone area, in the edit view.

## Collaborating on content writing

Contents created with Strapi may be edited by several admin panel users. Since these contents cannot be versioned, and to prevent any content loss, Strapi automatically informs users of concurrent edition situations.

When arriving on the edit view of a content type, if another user is already editing it, you will see the following window pop up on your screen.

[screenshot]

From there, you can choose between 2 options:

- Activate the read-only mode, meaning that you access the edit view of the content type and see its content, but you cannot do any action whatsoever, until the other user has finished and saved the current editing.
- Take over the editing of the page, meaning that you can edit the content type. However, the other user will see a notification pop up to inform them of your choice, and that their modifications cannot be saved.
