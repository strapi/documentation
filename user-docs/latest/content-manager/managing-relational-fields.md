# Managing relational fields

Some fields are linked to others through relations established from a content-type to another. These relations, which are established from the Content-Types Builder using the "Relation" field type, create relational fields.

Relational fields are before all else regular fields, meaning that their content is written from the edit view of the content-type they belong to (see [Writing content](writing-content.md)). However, these relational fields may have several values, but only specific ones would be relevant for the other content-type with which a relation was established. This is why it is possible from the edit view of the latter to choose what values from the relational fields are relevant.

::: details Example
In my Strapi admin panel I have created 2 collection types:
- Restaurant, where each entry is a restaurant
- Category, where each entry is a type of restaurant

I want to assign a category to each of my restaurants, therefore I have established a relation between my 2 collection types: restaurants can have one category.

In the Content Manager, from the edit view of my Restaurant entries, I can manage the Category relational field, and choose the relevant category value for my restaurant.

Relational fields of a content-type are managed from the Relational fields box, located in the right side of the edit view interface. It lists the names of all available relational fields.

Under each relational field name is displayed a listbox which allows to choose the values of the relational field that are relevant for the content-type. Depending on the type of relation that was established, you can either choose only one or several value.

## Managing one-choice relational fields

Many-to-one and one-to-one types of relation only allow to choose one value per relational field.

To select the relevant relational field's value for your content-type:

1. In the Relational fields box of your content-type's edit view, click on the listbox of the relational field.
2. Among the list of values, select the relevant one.

## Managing multiple-choices relational fields

Many-to-many and one-to-many types of relation allow to choose several values per relational field.

3. Repeat step 2 until all relevant values have been selected.
