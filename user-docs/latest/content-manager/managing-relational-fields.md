# Managing relational fields

Some fields are linked to others through relations from a content-type to another that are created from the Content-Types Builder using the "Relation" field type. Fields for which a relation was established with another content-type are called relational fields.

Relational fields are before all else regular fields, meaning that their content is written from the edit view of the content-type they belong to (see [Writing content](writing-content.md)). However, these fields may have several values, but only specific ones relevant for the other content-type with with a relation was established. This is why it is possible from the edit view of the latter to choose what values from the relational fields are relevant.

::: details Example
In my Strapi admin panel I have created 2 collection types, Restaurant (where each entry is a restaurant) and Category (where each entry is a type of cuisine). I want to assign a category to each of my restaurants, therefore I have established a relation between my 2 collection types. <br> In the Content Manager, from the edit view of my Restaurant entries, I can manage the Category relational field, and choose the relevant category value for my restaurant.

Relational fields of a content type are managed from the Relational fields box, located in the right side of the interface. It lists the names of all available relational fields.

Under each relational field is displayed a drop-down menu which allows to choose the values of the relational field that are relevant for the content-type. Depending on the type of relation that was established, you can either choose several or only one value.

## Managing one-choice relational fields

Many-to-one and one-to-one types of relation only allow to choose one value per relational field.
