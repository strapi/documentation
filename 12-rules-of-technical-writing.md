# 12 Rules of Technical Writing (Local Reference)

Purpose
- Provide a concise, actionable checklist for contributors and agents working on documentation.

1) Know the audience
- Write for the reader’s needs and prior knowledge; define acronyms on first use.

2) State the goal upfront
- Open with what the reader will achieve; add a short TL;DR when possible.

3) Use clear structure
- Organize with meaningful headings; prefer short sections and parallel structure.

4) Prefer active voice
- Use direct, imperative sentences (e.g., “Run the script”, not “The script should be run”).

5) Be concise
- Remove filler; one idea per sentence; keep paragraphs short.

6) Use consistent terminology
- Pick one term per concept; avoid synonyms that may confuse.

7) Show before you tell
- Provide minimal, runnable examples; annotate only what’s necessary.

8) Format code correctly
- Always specify code fence language; include `title=` and nearby `path:` hints when relevant.

9) Prefer lists for steps and options
- Use numbered lists for procedures; bullets for unordered items.

10) Link to context, not everything
- Link only when it aids the task; avoid link clutter.

11) Validate and test
- Run generators and validators; verify anchors and file paths in outputs.

12) Review for accuracy and bias
- Check facts, versions, and inclusivity; keep examples realistic.

Checklist (quick pass before review)
- Goal stated early; headings meaningful; sentences concise.
- Active voice; consistent terms; examples runnable; fences typed.
- Commands, paths, and code identifiers wrapped in backticks.
- Generators run; first 300 lines pasted when asked.
