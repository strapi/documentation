# Admin panel customization

The admin panel is a `node_module` that is similar to a plugin, with the slight difference that it encapsulates all the installed plugins of your application. It can be customized according to your needs and to better reflect your brand identity.

<!-- ? wording: should we use 'admin panel' or 'administration panel' throughout the whole documentation? -->

## Using the development mode and rebuilding the admin panel

### Development mode

While developing, it can be convenient to toggle hot reloading and get errors in the console.

For this, start Strapi in front-end development mode by running the application with the `--watch-admin` flag:


```bash
cd my-app # cd into the root directory of the Strapi application project
strapi develop --watch-admin
```

<!-- ? is this the best location for this tip? ðŸ¤” -->
::: tip
The admin panel supports dotenv variables.

All variables defined in a `.env` file and prefixed by `STRAPI_ADMIN_` are available while customizing the admin panel through `process.env`.
:::

### Build

Once satisfied with the changes, the admin panel needs to be built before deployment, by running the following command from the root directory of your project:

<code-group>

<code-block title="NPM">
```sh
npm  build
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="YARN">
```sh
yarn build
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="STRAPI CLI">
```sh
strapi build
```
</code-block>

</code-group>

This will replace the folder's content located at `./build`. Visit [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin) to make sure your updates have been taken into account. 

<!-- ? not sure when we need to rebuild/when hot reload won't work? -->


## Extending the admin panel

To extend the admin panel:

1. Create an `admin/extensions` folder at the root of your application.
2. Inside this folder, override admin panel files and functions.

::: strapi Admin Panel API
To extend the admin panel, you can take advantage of the [Admin Panel API](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/admin-panel.md).
:::

## Customizing the admin panel

The admin panel can be customized according to your needs, so you can make it reflect your identity.

:::caution
To apply the following customizations you need to [rebuild](#build) the admin panel.
:::
### Changing the access URL

By default, the administration panel is exposed via [http://localhost:1337/admin](http://localhost:1337/admin). For security reasons, this path can be updated.

**Example:**

To make the admin panel accessible from `http://localhost:1337/dashboard`, use this in the server configuration file:

**Path â€”** `./config/server.js`.

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  host: env('HOST', '0.0.0.0'),
  port: env.int('PORT', 1337),
  admin: {
    url: '/dashboard',
  },
});
```

:::strapi Advanced server settings
For more advanced settings please see the [server configuration](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations.md#server) documentation.
:::

#### Changing the host and port

By default, the front-development server runs on `localhost:8000`. However, you can change this setting by updating the following configuration:

**Path â€”** `./config/server.js`.

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  host: env('HOST', '0.0.0.0'),
  port: env.int('PORT', 1337),
  admin: {
    host: 'my-host', // only used along with `strapi develop --watch-admin` command
    port: 3000, // only used along with `strapi develop --watch-admin` command
  },
});
```

### Changing the configuration

Update the default configuration file for the admin panel to:

* [update the logo](#updating-logos) and [favicon](#updating-the-favicon)
* [extend the theme](#extending-the-theme)
* [update the list of locales](#updating-locales) and extend translations
* [change the menu logo](#updating-the-logo)
* [toggle the tutorials](#toggling-the-display-of-tutorial-videos)
* [toggle notifications about new Strapi releases](#toggling-strapi-releases-notifications)

::: strapi Admin Panel `config` object
The full list of parameters for the `config` object of the admin panel can be found in the [Admin Panel API](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/admin-panel.md#configuration) documentation.
:::

::: details Example of a custom configuration for the admin panel:

<!-- ? is ./admin/src/app.js the correct path? -->
```jsx
// path: ./admin/src/app.js

import AuthLogo from './extensions/my-logo.png';
import MenuLogo from './extensions/logo.png';
import favicon from './extensions/favicon.ico';

export default {
  config: {
    // Change the Auth views strapi logo
    auth: {
      logo: AuthLogo,
    },
   // Change the favicon
    head: {
      favicon: favicon,
    },
    // Add a new locale other than en
    locales: ['fr',],
    // Change the menu logo
    menu: {
      logo: MenuLogo,
    },
    // Override or extend the theme
    theme: {},
    // Extend the translations
    translations: {
      fr: {
        'Auth.form.email.label': 'test',
      },
    },
   // Display the tutorials bow
    tutorials: false,
   // Display the release notification
    notifications: { release: false },
  },
};

```

:::

#### Updating locales

To update the list of available locales in the admin panel, use the `config.locales` array:

<!-- ? is it the right path? -->
<!-- ? is it mandatory to include the webpack key to update locales, or was it just for a copy/paste from another example? -->
```jsx
// path: ./my-app/strapi-admin.js

module.exports = {
  // Custom webpack config
  webpack: (config, webpack) => {
    // Note: we provide webpack above so you should not `require` it
    // Perform customizations to webpack config
    // Important: return the modified config
    return config;
  },

  // App customisations
  app: config => {
    config.locales = ['ru', 'zh'];

    return config;
  },
};
```

::: note NOTES

* The `en` locale cannot be removed from the build as it is both the fallback (if a translation is not found in a locale, the `en` will be used) and the default locale (used when a user opens the administration panel for the first time).
* It is not possible to add a locale that is not already created in Strapi's monorepo.
* The list of supported locales is not available.
<!-- ? isn't it the same list of locales that we use in i18n? (if yes, we could link to the JSON in our Github) -->
:::

#### Updating logos

The Strapi admin panel displays a logo in 2 different locations, represented by 2 different keys in the [admin panel configuration](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/admin-panel.md#configuration):

| Location in the UI     | Configuration key to update |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------- |
| On the login page      | `config.auth.logo`          |
| In the main navigation | `config.menu.logo`          |

To update the logos, put image files in the `./extensions` folder and update the corresponding keys.

::: tip
Make sure the size of your image is the same as the existing one (434px x 120px).
:::

#### Updating the favicon

To update the favicon, put a favicon file in the `.extensions` folder and update the `config.head.favicon` key in the [admin panel configuration](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/admin-panel.md#configuration).

#### Toggling the display of tutorial videos

To disable the information box containing the tutorial videos, set the `config.tutorials` key to `false`.

#### Toggling Strapi releases notifications

To disable notifications about new Strapi releases, set the `config.notifications.release` key to `false`.

#### Extending the theme

<!-- TODO: complete this section once design system is ready -->

To extend the theme, use the `config.theme` key.


### Customizing a plugin

<!-- TODO: review this section -->

To change the current WYSIWYG, you can either install a plugin, or take advantage of the bootstrap lifecycle (see [Admin Panel API](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/admin-panel.html#bootstrap)).

<!-- TODO: Add Component API -->

### Customizing the 'Forgotten password' email

To customize the 'Forgotten password' email, provide your own template (formatted as a [lodash template](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#template)).

The template will be compiled with the following variables: `url`, `user.email`, `user.username`, `user.firstname`, `user.lastname`.

**Example**:

**Path -** `./config/servers.js`

```js
const forgotPasswordTemplate = require('./email-templates/forgot-password');

module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  // ...
  admin: {
    // ...
    forgotPassword: {
      from: 'support@mywebsite.fr',
      replyTo: 'support@mywebsite.fr',
      emailTemplate: forgotPasswordTemplate,
    },
    // ...
  },
  // ...
});
```

**Path -** `./config/email-templates/forgot-password.js`

```js
const subject = `Reset password`;

const html = `<p>Hi <%= user.firstname %></p>
<p>Sorry you lost your password. You can click here to reset it: <%= url %></p>`;

const text = `Hi <%= user.firstname %>
Sorry you lost your password. You can click here to reset it: <%= url %>`;

module.exports = {
  subject,
  text,
  html,
};
```



### Custom Webpack Config

In order to extend the usage of webpack, define a function that extends its configuration inside `./admin/webpack.config.js`, like so:

```js
module.exports = {
  webpack: (config, webpack) => {
    // Note: we provide webpack above so you should not `require` it

    // Perform customizations to webpack config
    config.plugins.push(new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/\/__tests__\//));

    // Important: return the modified config
    return config;
  },
};
```

::: note
Only `./admin/app.js` and the files under the `./admin/extensions` folder are being watched by the webpack dev server.
:::

## Deploying the admin panel

The administration is nothing more than a React front-end application calling an API. The front end and the back end are independent and can be deployed on different servers which brings us to different scenarios:

* Deploy the entire project on the same server.
* Deploy the administration panel on a server (AWS S3, Azure, etc) different from the API server 

Build configurations differ for each case.

### Deploy the entire project on the same server

This is the default behavior and the build configuration will be automatically set. The server will start on the defined port and the administration panel will be accessible through `http://yourdomain.com:1337/dashboard`.

:::tip
You might want to [change the path to access the administration panel](#changing-the-access-url).
:::

### Deploy the administration panel on a server different from the API server

It's very common to deploy the front end and the back end on different servers. Here is the required configuration to handle this case:

**Path â€”** `./config/server.js`.

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  host: env('HOST', '0.0.0.0'),
  port: env.int('PORT', 1337),
  url: 'http://yourbackend.com',
  admin: {
    url: '/', // Note: The administration will be accessible from the root of the domain (ex: http://yourfrontend.com/)
    serveAdminPanel: false, // http://yourbackend.com will not serve any static admin files
  },
});
```

After running `yarn build` with this configuration, the `build` folder will be created/overwritten. Use this folder to serve it from another server with the domain of your choice (e.g. `http://yourfrontend.com`).

The administration URL will then be `http://yourfrontend.com` and every request from the panel will hit the backend at `http://yourbackend.com`.

:::note
If you add a path to the `url` option, it won't prefix your app. To do so, you need to also use a proxy server like Nginx (see [optional software guides](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment.md#optional-software-guides)).
