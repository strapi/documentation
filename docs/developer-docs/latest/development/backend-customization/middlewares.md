# Middlewares customization

::: strapi Different types of middlewares

In Strapi, 2 middleware concepts coexist:

- **Strapi middlewares** are [configured and enabled](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/required/middlewares.md) for the entire Strapi server application. These middlewares can be applied at the application level or at the API level. <br/>The present documentation describes how to implement them.<br/>Plugins can also add Strapi middlewares (see [Server API documentation](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/server.md#middlewares)).

- **Route middlewares** have a more limited scope and are configured and used as middlewares at the route level. They are described in the [routes documentation](/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization/routes.md#middlewares).

:::

## Implementation

A new application-level or API-level middleware can be implemented:
- with the [interactive CLI command `strapi generate`](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.md#strapi-generate)
- or manually by creating a JavaScript file in the appropriate folder (see [project structure](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/file-structure.md)):

- `./src/middlewares/` for application-level middlewares
- `./src/api/[api-name]/middlewares/` for API-level middlewares
- `./src/plugins/[plugin-name]/middlewares/` for [plugin middlewares](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/plugin-api-reference/server.md#middlewares)

Middlewares working with the REST API are functions like the following:

```js
// path: ./src/middlewares/my-middleware.js or ./src/api/[api-name]/middlewares/my-middleware.js
module.exports = (config, { strapi })=> {
  return (context, next) => {};
};
```

Once created, custom middlewares should be added to the [middlewares configuration file](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/required/middlewares.md#loading-order) or Strapi won't load them.

<!-- TODO: update the example below, was copied & pasted from v3 but won't probably work as-is -->
::: details Example of a custom timer middleware

```js
module.exports = () => {
  return async (ctx, next) => {
    const start = Date.now();

    await next();

    const delta = Math.ceil(Date.now() - start);
    ctx.set('X-Response-Time', delta + 'ms');
  };
};
```

:::

The GraphQL plugin also allows [implementing custom middlewares](/developer-docs/latest/plugins/graphql.md#middlewares), with a different syntax.

## Usage

Middlewares are called different ways depending on their scope:

- use `global::middleware-name` for application-level middlewares
- use `api::api-name.middleware-name` for API-level middlewares
- use `pluigin:plugin-name.middleware-name` for plugin middlewares

::: tip
To list all the registered middlewares, run `yarn strapi middlewares:list`.
