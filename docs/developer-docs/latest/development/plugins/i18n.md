# üåç  Internationalization (i18n)

The Internationalization (i18n) plugin allows Strapi users to create, manage and distribute localized content in different languages, called "locales". For more information about the concept of internationalization, please refer to the
[W3C definition](https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-i18n.en#i18n).

The i18n plugin:

- allows admin panel users to create several localized versions of their content (see [user guide](/user-docs/latest/content-manager/translating-content.md))
- allows developers to build localized projects by fetching and consuming the right content depending on the country/language of the audience.

::: tip NOTE
The i18n plugin does not automatically translate the users' content nor adapt the admin interface to languages specificities (e.g. displaying the admin panel in Right To Left format).
:::

## Installation

::: warning PREREQUISITES
The Internationalization plugin is installed by default on all Strapi applications running on version 3.6.0 or higher. For lower versions, a migration is needed (see [Update Strapi version](/developer-docs/latest/update-migration-guides/update-version.md)), as well as a manual installation of the plugin.
:::

The plugin can be installed:

- [from the Marketplace](/user-docs/latest/plugins/installing-plugins-via-marketplace.md),
- or using the Terminal, by running one of the following commands:

:::: tabs

::: tab yarn

``` bash
yarn strapi install i18n
```

:::

::: tab npm

``` bash
npm run strapi install i18n
```

:::

::::

## Usage with Strapi Content API

The i18n plugin adds new features to the [Content API](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/content-api/content-api.md):

- a new [`locale`](#getting-localized-entries-with-the-locale-parameter) parameter to fetch content only for a specified locale
- the ability to create a localized entry, either [from scratch](#creating-a-new-localized-entry) or [for an existing localized entry](#creating-a-localization-for-an-existing-entry)

### Getting localized entries with the `locale` parameter

The `locale` [API parameter](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/content-api/content-api.md#api-parameters) can be used to fetch entries only for a specified locale. It takes a locale code as value (see [full list of available locales](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/packages/strapi-plugin-i18n/constants/iso-locales.json)).

:::tip TIP
 To fetch content for a locale, make sure it has been already [added to Strapi in the admin panel](/user-docs/latest/settings/managing-global-settings.md#configuring-internationalization-locales).
:::

The format for a GET request is the following:

```http
GET /{content-type}?_locale={locale-code}
```

Use `all` as a value for the locale code, as in `http://localhost:1337/restaurants?_locale=all`, to fetch entries for all locales that have been configured in the admin panel.

If the `locale` parameter isn't defined, it will be set to the default locale. `en` is the default locale when i18n plugin is installed, so by default a GET request to `http://localhost:1337/restaurants` will return the same response as a request to `http://localhost:1337/restaurants?_locale=en`.

::: tip TIP
Another locale can be [set as the default locale](/user-docs/latest/settings/managing-global-settings.md#adding-a-new-locale) in the admin panel.
:::

When the i18n plugin is installed, the response to requests includes fields that are specific to internationalization:

- `locale` (string) is the locale code for the content entry
- `localizations` (array) lists the existing localizations for this content entry; these localizations objects have 3 properties:
  - `id` (number|string) is the id of the localized content entry
  - `locale`(string) is the locale code for the localized content entry
  - `published_at` (string) is the date and time when the localized content entry was [published](/developer-docs/latest/concepts/draft-and-publish.md#publishing-a-draft), in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format


:::: tabs

::: tab Request

**Example request**

```http
GET http://localhost:1337/restaurants?_locale=fr
```

:::

::: tab Response

**Example response**

```json
[
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Can Alegria",
    "description": "Can Alegria restaurant description in French",
    "locale": "fr",
    "localizations": [
      {
        "id": 3,
        "locale": "en",
        "published_at": "2021-04-07T10:10:31.949Z"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "name": "She's Cake",
    "description": "She's Cake restaurant description in French",
    "locale": "fr",
    "localizations": []
  }
]
```

In the example response above:

- restaurant with `"id": 4` is a French (`"locale": "fr"`) localization of the existing restaurant with `"id": 3` (created for the default `en` locale), as shown in the `localizations` object included in the response (see [creating a localization for an existing entry](#creating-a-localization-for-an-existing-entry)).
- restaurant with `"id": "8"` was created from scratch using the API, passing the `locale: fr` in the request body (see [creating a new localized entry](#creating-a-new-localized-entry)).
:::
::::

### Creating a new localized entry

To create a localized entry from scratch, send a POST request to the Content API.

If no locale has been passed in the request body, the entry is created using the default locale for the application:

:::: tabs
::: tab Request

**Example request**

```http
POST http://localhost:1337/restaurants
```

```json
{
  "name": "Oplato",
  "description": "Oplato restaurant description in English"
}
```

:::

::: tab Response

**Example response**

```json
{
    "id": 5,
    "name": "Oplato",
    "description": "Oplato restaurant description in English",
    "locale": "en",
    "localizations": []
}
```

:::
::::

To create a localized entry for a locale different from the default one, add the `locale` attribute to the body of the POST request:

:::: tabs
::: tab Request

**Example request**

```http
POST http://localhost:1337/restaurants
```

```json
{
  "name": "She's Cake",
  "description": "She's Cake restaurant description in French",
  "locale": "fr"
}
```

:::

::: tab Response
**Example response**

```json
{
    "id": 8,
    "name": "She's Cake",
    "description": "She's Cake restaurant description in French",
    "locale": "fr",
    "localizations": []
}
```

:::
::::

### Creating a localization for an existing entry

To create another localization for an existing localized entry, send a POST request to the appropriate URL depending on the type of content:

| Content-Type    | Request URL format                       |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Collection type | `POST /{content-type}/:id/localizations` |  
| Single type     | `POST /{content-type}/localizations`     |

When creating a localization for existing localized entries, the body of the POST request can only accept localized fields.

::: tip TIP
The Content-Type should have the [`createlocalization` permission](/user-docs/latest/users-roles-permissions/configuring-administrator-roles.md#collection-and-single-types) enabled, otherwise the POST request will return a `403: Forbidden` status.
:::

#### Creating a localization for a collection type

When sending a POST request to a collection type, Strapi will:

1. use the `id` as a base entry for the non-localized fields and copy them in the new entry
2. then create a new entry for the given locale and link it with the base entry.

:::: tabs

::: tab Request

**Example request**

```http
POST http://localhost:1337/restaurants/8/localizations
```

```json
{
  "locale": "en",
  "name": "She's Cake",
  "description": "She's Cake restaurant description in English"
}
```

This request:

1. creates a new entry in `en`
2. links the created entry with `restaurant:8` (they will share the same `localizations` object)
3. copies every non-localized fields from `restaurant:8` into the new entry and keeps the localized fields from the request's body

:::

::: tab Response

**Example reponse**

```json
{
    "id": 9,
    "name": "She's Cake",
    "description": "She's Cake restaurant description in English",
    "locale": "en",
    "localizations": [
        {
            "id": 8,
            "locale": "fr",
            "published_at": "2021-04-07T13:22:46.589Z"
        }
    ]
}
```

**Example request**

```http
POST http://localhost:1337/homepage/localizations
```

```json

  "locale": "fr",
  "title": "Bienvenue sur FoodAdvisor !"
}
```

    {
        "id": 1,
        "locale": "en",
        "published_at": "2021-04-14T12:49:37.055Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Updating an entry

Currently, it is not possible to change the locale of an existing localized entry.

When updating a localized entry (with `PUT /{localized-content-type}/:id`), if you set a `locale` attribute in the request body, it will be ignored.

## Usage with the GraphQL plugin

The i18n plugin adds new features to the [GraphQL plugin](/developer-docs/latest/development/plugins/graphql.md):

- The `locale` and `localizations` fields are added to the [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) schema.
- The GraphQL [query API](/developer-docs/latest/development/plugins/graphql.md#query-api) can be used to:
  - [query with the `locale` argument](#getting-localized-entries-with-graphql) on collection types and single types
  - [create new localizations with a mutation](#creating-new-localized-entries-with-graphql) for collection types and single types
  - [update](#updating-a-localized-single-type-with-graphql) and [delete](#deleting-a-localization-for-a-single-type-with-graphql) a localization with a mutation on single types

### Getting localized entries with GraphQL

Queries can use the `locale` argument to fetch entries only for a specified locale.

::: tip TIP
To fetch entries for all locales, use `locale: "all"` in the query.

## Configuration in production environments

A `STRAPI_PLUGIN_I18N_INIT_LOCALE_CODE` [environment variable](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations.md#environment-variables) can be configured to set the initialization locale for your environment. The value used for this variable should be a string (see [full list of available locales](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/blob/master/packages/strapi-plugin-i18n/constants/iso-locales.json)).

This is useful when a Strapi app is deployed in production, with the i18n plugin installed and enabled on your content types for the first time. On a fresh i18n plugin installation, `en` is the default locale. So if the database does not contain any locale, and no `STRAPI_PLUGIN_I18N_INIT_LOCALE_CODE` is set for the environment, the content of the content types with i18n enabled will be automatically migrated to the `en` locale. But if the `STRAPI_PLUGIN_I18N_INIT_LOCALE_CODE` is defined, then the content will be migrated to this locale. Using this environment variable saves you from having to manually update the locale for existing content entries.
