# Internationalization (i18n)
<!-- ? wondering if it would be a good idea to add the 🌍 icon to the h1 — if yes, we should do this for the h1 of other plugins as well -->

> Internationalization is the design and development of a product, application or document content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language.

<!-- ? not sure if using a citation is a good idea to introduce/define i18n — feedback is welcome! -->

The Internationalization (i18n) plugin allows Strapi users to create, manage and distribute content in several languages.
It's an optional plugin that you can [install from the Marketplace](/user-docs/latest/plugins/installing-plugins-via-marketplace.md).
<!-- TODO: add programmatic instructions to install plugin? like strapi install i18n-->

The i18n plugin:

- allows admin panel users to create several localized versions of their content (see [user guide](/user-docs/latest/content-manager/translating-content.md))
- allows developers to build localized projects by fetching and consuming the right content depending on the country/language of the audience.

::: tip NOTE
The i18n plugin does not automatically translate the users' content nor adapt the admin interface to languages specificities (like displaying the admin panel in Right To Left (RTL) format).
:::

The i18n plugin adds new features to the [Content API](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/content-api/content-api.md):

- a new [`locale`](#getting-localized-entries-with-the-locale-parameter) parameter to fetch content only for a specified locale
- the ability to create a localized entry, either [from scratch](#creating-a-new-localized-entry) or [for an existing localized entry](#creating-a-localization-for-an-existing-entry)

## Getting localized entries with the `locale` parameter

The `locale` [API parameter](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/content-api/content-api.md#api-parameters) can be used to fetch entries only for a specified locale. It takes a locale code as value.

:::tip TIP
 To fetch content for a locale, make sure it has been already [added to Strapi in the admin panel GUI](/user-docs/latest/settings/managing-global-settings.md#configuring-internationalization-locales).
:::

The format for a GET request is the following:

```js
GET /{content-type}?_locale={locale-code}
```

If the `locale` parameter isn't defined, it will be set to the default locale. `en` is the default locale when i18n plugin is installed, so by default a GET request to `http://localhost:1337/restaurants` will return the same response as a request to `http://localhost:1337/restaurants?_locale=en`.

::: tip TIP
Another locale can be [set as the default locale](/user-docs/latest/settings/managing-global-settings.md#adding-a-new-locale) in the admin panel.
:::

<!-- ? Should we be more explicit about what a locale code is? What are the available locales? Is there a list? -->
<!-- TODO maybe add a link to user guide here if Mégane describes the list of available locales -->

When the i18n plugin is installed, the response to requests includes fields that are specific to internationalization:

- `locale` (string) is the locale code for the content entry
- `localizations` (array) lists the existing localizations for this content entry; these localizations objects have 3 properties:
  - `id` (number|string) is the id of the localized content entry
  - `locale`(string) is the locale code for the localized content entry
  - `published_at` (string) is the date and time when the localized content entry was [published](/developer-docs/latest/concepts/draft-and-publish.md#publishing-a-draft), in [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) format

In the example response above:

- restaurant with `"id": 4` is a French (`"locale": "fr"`) localization of the existing restaurant with `"id": 3` (created for the default `en` locale), as shown in the `localizations` object included in the response (see [creating a localization for an existing entry](#creating-a-localization-for-an-existing-entry)).
- restaurant with `"id": "8"` was created from scratch using the API, passing the `locale: fr` in the request body (see [creating a new localized entry](#creating-a-new-localized-entry)).

## Creating a new localized entry

To create a localized entry from scratch, send a POST request to the Content API.

If no locale has been passed in the request body, the entry is created using the default locale for the application:

  "description": "Restaurant with terrace in front of the lake"

To create a localized entry for a locale different from the default one, add the `locale` attribute to the body of the POST request:

## Creating a localization for an existing entry

To create another localization for an existing localized entry, send a POST request to the appropriate URL depending on the type of content:

| Content-Type    | Request URL format                       |
|:----------------|:-----------------------------------------|
| Single Type     | `POST /{content-type}/:id/localizations` |  
| Collection Type | `POST /{content-type}/localizations`     |


::: warning CAUTION
When creating a localization for existing localized entries, the body of the POST request can only accept localized fields.
:::

When sending the request to a single type, Strapi will:

1. use the `id` as base entry for the non-localized fields and copy them in the new entry
2. then create a new entry for the given locale and link it with the base entry.
:::: tabs

::: tab Request

**Example request**

```js
POST http://localhost:1337/restaurants/8/localizations
```

**body**
<!-- * We never used "body" before, see existing entries in Content API. I think it would be a good idea — so it's even more explicit that this code block is the body of the request. If we agree on this, I should update all existing examples in Content API to follow this format. -->

```json
{
  "locale": "en",
  "name": "Restaurant F",
  "description": "Restaurant facing the sea"
}
```

This query:

1. creates a new entry in `en`
2. links the created entry with `restaurant:8` (they will share the same `localizations` object)
3. copies every non-localized fields from `restaurant:8` into the new entry and keeps the localized fields from the request's body

        }
    ]
}
```

::::

<!-- ? should we also add an example of creating a localization for a collection type? -->

::: tip TIP
The Content-Type should have the [`createlocalization` permission]() enabled, otherwise the POST request will return a `403: Forbidden` status.
<!-- TODO: insert cross-link to user guide on how to activate `createlocalization` permission in the admin panel -->

## Updating an entry

Currently, it is not possible to change the locale of an existing localized entry using the Content API.

When updating a localized entry (with `PUT /{localized-content-type}/:id`), if you set a `locale` attribute in the request body, it will be ignored.
