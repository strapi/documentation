# TypeScript development

::: callout 🚧  TypeScript documentation
This section is still a work in progress and will continue to be updated and improved. Migrating existing Strapi applications written in JavaScript is not currently recommended. In the meantime, feel free to ask for help on the [forum](https://forum.strapi.io/) or on the community [Discord](https://discord.strapi.io). Check the [beta documentation](docs-next.strapi.io) for faster access to TypeScript documentation.

::: prerequisites
To start developing in TypeScript create a new project using the [CLI](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/cli.md)

:::

TypeScript adds an additional type system layer above JavaScript, which means that existing JavaScript code is also TypeScript code. Strapi supports TypeScript in new projects on v4.2.0 and above. To start developing in TypeScript use the [CLI documentation](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/installation/cli.md) to create a new TypeScript project. Additionally, the [project structure](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/file-structure.md) and [TypeScript configuration](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/optional/typescript.md) sections have TypeScript-specific resources for understanding and configuring an application. The Developer Documentation contains code examples in both JavaScript and TypeScript.

## Develop a plugin using TypeScript

New plugins can be generated following the [plugins development documentation](/developer-docs/latest/development/plugins-development.md). There are 2 important distinctions for TypeScript applications:

- After creating the plugin, run `yarn install` or `npm run install` in the plugin directory `src/admin/plugins/[my-plugin-name]` to install the dependencies for the plugin.
- Run `yarn build` or `npm run build` in the plugin directory `src/admin/plugins/[my-plugin-name]` to build the admin panel including the plugin.

::: note
It is not necessary to repeat the `yarn install` or `npm run install` command after the initial installation. The `yarn build` or `npm run build` command is necessary to implement any plugin development that affects the admin panel.
