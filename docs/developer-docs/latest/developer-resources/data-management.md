# Data Management System <BetaBadge />

:::callout ðŸš§ Feature under development
The data management system is under development. Not all use cases are covered by the initial release. You can provide feedback about desired functionality on the [Strapi feedback website](https://feedback.strapi.io).
:::

Occasionally you need to move data out of or into a Strapi instance. The data management system allows you to efficiently extract data from an existing instance or archive and import that data into a separate instance. Strapi provides CLI-based commands that allow you to export and import data. Common use cases include:

- creating a data backup,
- restoring data from a backup.

 The following documentation details examples of how to use the `strapi export` and `strapi import` commands.

:::strapi Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)
The `strapi export` and `strapi import` CLI commands with all of the available options are listed in the [Command Line Interface documentation](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.md#strapi-export).
:::

## Export data using the CLI tool

The `strapi export` command by default exports data as an encrypted and compressed `tar.gz` file. The default export command exports:

- the project configuration,
- entities: all of your content,
- links: relations between your entities,
- assets: files stored in the uploads folder,
- schemas,
- the `metadata.json` file.

:::caution
Admin users and API tokens are not exported.
:::

### Name the export file

Exported data are contained in a `.tar` file that is automatically named using the format `export_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS`. You can optionally name the exported file by passing the `--file` or `-f` option with the `strapi export` command. Do not include a file extension.

#### Example: Export data with a custom filename
<br/>
<code-group>
<code-block title="YARN">

```bash
yarn strapi export --file my-strapi-export
```

</code-block>

<code-block title="NPM">

```bash
npm strapi export  --file my-strapi-export
```

</code-block>
</code-group>

### Configure data encryption

The default `strapi export` command encrypts your project data using `aes-128-ecb` encryption and adds the file extension `.enc`. To use encryption you need to pass an encryption key using the `-k` or `--key` option or enter an encryption key when prompted. The encryption key is a `string` with no minimum character count.

:::tip Encryption keys
Strong encryption keys are encouraged to protect sensitive data in your project. [OpenSSL](https://www.openssl.org/) is a resource for generating encryption keys.
:::

To disable encryption, pass the `--no-encrypt` option with the `strapi export` command.

#### Example: Export data without encryption

<br/>
<code-group>
<code-block title="YARN">

```bash
yarn strapi export --no-encrypt
```

</code-block>

<code-block title="NPM">

```bash
npm strapi export --no-encrypt
```

</code-block>
</code-group>

#### Example: Export data with the encryption `--key` option

<br/>
<code-group>
<code-block title="YARN">

```bash
yarn strapi export --key my-encryption-key
```

</code-block>

<code-block title="NPM">

```bash
npm strapi export --key my-encryption-key
```

</code-block>
</code-group>

### Disable data compression

The default `strapi export` command compresses your project data using `gzip` compression and adds the `.gz` file extension.

To disable compression, pass the `--no-compress` option with the `strapi export` command.

#### Example: Export data without compression
<br/>
<code-group>
<code-block title="YARN">

```bash
yarn strapi export --no-compress
```

</code-block>

<code-block title="NPM">

```bash
npm strapi export --no-compress
```

</code-block>
</code-group>

## Import data using the CLI tool

:::warning
`strapi import` will delete all of the existing data prior to importing the backup file. Restored data does not include the `users` table, which means that `createdBy` and `updatedBy` are empty in a restored instance.  
:::

To import data into a Strapi instance use the `strapi import` command in the project root directory. Specify the file to be imported using the `-f` or `--file` option. The filename, extension, and path are required. If the file is encrypted, you will be prompted for the encryption key before the import starts.
 
#### Example: Minimum command to import data from a file in the Strapi project root
<br/>
<code-group>
<code-block title="YARN">

```bash
yarn strapi import -f export_20221213105643.tar.gz.enc
```

</code-block>

<code-block title="NPM">

```bash
npm strapi import -f export_20221213105643.tar.gz.enc
```

</code-block>
</code-group>

### Provide an encryption key

If you are importing data from an encrypted file the encryption key can be passed with the `strapi import` command by using the `-k` or `--key` option.

#### Example: Pass the encryption key with the `strapi import` command
<br/>
<code-group>
<code-block title="YARN">

```bash
yarn strapi import -f export_20221213105643.tar.gz.enc --key my-encryption-key
```

</code-block>

<code-block title="NPM">

```bash
npm strapi import -f export_20221213105643.tar.gz.enc --key my-encryption-key
```

</code-block>
</code-group>
