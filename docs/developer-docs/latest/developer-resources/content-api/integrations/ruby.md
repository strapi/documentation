# Getting Started with Ruby

This integration guide is following the [Getting started guide](/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.md). We assume that you have completed [Step 8](/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.md#_8-publish-the-content) and therefore can consume the API by browsing this [url](http://localhost:1337/restaurants).

If you haven't gone through the getting started guide, the way you request a Strapi API with [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) remains the same except that you will not fetch the same content.

## Create a Ruby file

Be sure to have [Ruby installed](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) on your computer.

```bash
mkdir ruby-app && cd ruby-app
touch script.rb
```

## Use an HTTP client

Many HTTP clients are available but in this documentation we'll use [HTTParty](https://github.com/jnunemaker/httparty).

- Create a `Gemfile` containing the following:

```
source "https://rubygems.org"

gem "httparty"
```

- Install your gems by running the following command:

```bash
bundle install
```

## GET Request your collection type

Execute a `GET` request on the `restaurant` Collection Type in order to fetch all your restaurants.

Be sure that you activated the `find` permission for the `restaurant` Collection Type.

_Request_

```ruby
HTTParty.get('http://localhost:1337/restaurants',
  header: {
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json'
  })
```

_Response_

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Biscotte Restaurant",
    "description": "Welcome to Biscotte restaurant! Restaurant Biscotte offers a cuisine based on fresh, quality products, often local, organic when possible, and always produced by passionate producers.",
    "created_by": {

      "id": 1,
      "firstname": "Paul",
      "lastname": "Bocuse",
      "username": null
    },
    "created_at": "2020-07-31T11:37:16.964Z",
    "updated_at": "2020-07-31T11:37:16.975Z",

        "updated_at": "2020-07-31T11:36:23.172Z"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Example

```ruby
require 'httparty'

class Restaurant
  include HTTParty

  def initialize
    @api_url = "http://localhost:1337"
  end

  def all
    self.class.get("#{@api_url}/restaurants")
  end

end

restaurant = Restaurant.new
puts restaurant.all
```

## POST Request your collection type

Execute a `POST` request on the `restaurant` Collection Type in order to create a restaurant.

Be sure that you activated the `create` permission for the `restaurant` Collection Type and the `find` permission for the `category` Collection type.

In this example a `japanese` category has been created which has the id: 3.

_Request_

```ruby
HTTParty.post("http://localhost:1337/restaurants",
  body: {
    name: 'Dolemon Sushi',
    description: 'Unmissable Japanese Sushi restaurant. The cheese and salmon makis are delicious',
    categories: [3],
  },
  header: {
    'Content-Type' => 'application/json'
  }

```ruby
require 'httparty'

class Restaurant

  end

  def create(params)
    self.class.post("#{@api_url}/restaurants",
      body: {
        name: params[:name],

## Conclusion

Here is how to request your Collection Types in Strapi using Ruby. When you create a Collection Type or a Single Type you will have a certain number of REST API endpoints available to interact with.
