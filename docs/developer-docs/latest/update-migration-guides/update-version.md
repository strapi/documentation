# Upgrade Strapi version

Strapi periodically releases code improvements through upgrades. Upgrades contain no breaking changes and are announced in both the terminal and in the administration panel. [Migration guides](/developer-docs/latest/update-migration-guides/migration-guides.md) are provided whenver a new Strapi version includes breaking changes. 

:::caution
 [Plugins extension](/developer-docs/latest/plugins/users-permissions.md) that create custom code or modify existing code will need to be updated and compared to the changes in the repository. Not updating the plugin extensions could break the application.

## Upgrading the dependencies

::: prerequisites
- Stop the server before starting the upgrade.
- Confirm there are no [migrations](/developer-docs/latest/update-migration-guides/migration-guides.md) between the current and ultimate Strapi versions.
