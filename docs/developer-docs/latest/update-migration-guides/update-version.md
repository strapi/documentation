# Upgrade Strapi version

Strapi periodically releases code improvements through upgrades. Upgrades contain no breaking changes and are announced in both the terminal and in the administration panel. [Migration guides](/developer-docs/latest/update-migration-guides/migration-guides.md) are provided whenever a new Strapi version includes breaking changes.

:::caution
 [Plugins extension](/developer-docs/latest/plugins/users-permissions.md) that create custom code or modify existing code will need to be updated and compared to the changes in the repository. Not updating the plugin extensions could break the application.
:::

## Step 1: Upgrade the dependencies

::: prerequisites

- Stop the server before starting the upgrade.
- Confirm there are no [migrations](/developer-docs/latest/update-migration-guides/migration-guides.md) between the current and ultimate Strapi versions.
:::

1. Upgrade all of the Strapi packages in the `package.json`.

```jsx
// path: package.json

{
  // ...
  "dependencies": {
    "@strapi/strapi": "4.4.1",
    "@strapi/plugin-users-permissions": "4.4.1",
    "@strapi/plugin-i18n": "4.4.1",
    "better-sqlite3": "7.4.6"
    // ...
  }
}

```

2. Save the edited `package.json` file.

```
</code-block>

<code-block title="YARN">
```sh
yarn build
```
</code-block>

</code-group>

## Step 3: Start the application

<code-group>

<code-block title="NPM">
```sh
npm run develop
```
</code-block>

<code-block title="YARN">
```sh
yarn develop
```
