# v4 code migration: Updating controllers

!!!include(developer-docs/latest/update-migration-guides/migration-guides/v4/snippets/code-migration-intro.md)!!!

::: strapi v3/v4 comparison
In both Strapi v3 and v4, creating content-types automatically generates core API controllers. Controllers are JavaScript files that contain a list of methods, called actions.

In Strapi v3, controllers export an object containing actions  that are merged with the existing actions of core API controllers, allowing customization.

In Strapi v4, controllers export the result of a call to the [`createCoreController` factory function](/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization/controllers.md#implementation), with or without further customization.
:::

Migrating [controllers](/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization/controllers.md) to Strapi v4 consists in making sure that each controller is located in the proper folder and uses the `createCoreController` factory function introduced in v4.

Due to the differences between controllers implementation in Strapi v3 and v4, it's recommended to create a new controller file, then optionally bring existing v3 customizations into the new file and adapt them when necessary.

A new controller can be created:

- manually, starting at step 1 of the following procedure,
- or automatically, using the [`strapi generate` interactive CLI](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/cli/CLI.md#strapi-generate) then jumping to step 2 of the following procedure.
<!-- ? I noticed the strapi generate CLI generates an empty controller and not a call to createCoreController, is it intended ? -->

To create a v4 controller:

1. Create a `api/<api-name>/controllers/<controller-name>.js` file inside the `./src` folder (see [project structure](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/file-structure.md)).

2. Copy and paste the following code at the top of the `./src/api/<api-name>/controllers/<controller-name>.js` file. The code imports the `createCoreController` factory function from the factories included with the core of Strapi:

    ```js
    const { createCoreController } = require('@strapi/strapi').factories;
    ```

3. Copy and paste the following code, replacing `api-name` and `content-type-name` with appropriate names. The code exports the result of a call to the `createCoreController` factory function, passing the unique identifier of the content-type (e.g. `api::api-name.content-type-name`) as an argument:

    ```js
    module.exports = createCoreController('api::api-name.content-type-name')
    ```

4. (_optional_) To customize controller actions, pass a second argument to the `createCoreController` factory function. This argument can be either an object or a function returning an object. The object contains methods, which can either be entirely new actions or replace or extend existing actions of core API controllers (see [controllers implementation documentation](/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization/controllers.md#adding-a-new-controller)).

::: details Example of a v4 controller without customization

  ```jsx
  // path: ./src/api/<content-type-name>/controllers/<controller-name>.js

  const { createCoreController } = require('@strapi/strapi').factories;

  module.exports = createCoreController('api::api-name.content-type-name');
  ```

:::

::: details Example of a v4 controller with customization

  ```jsx
  // path: ./src/api/<content-type-name>/controllers/<controller-name>.js

  const { createCoreController } = require('@strapi/strapi').factories;

  module.exports = createCoreController('api::api-name.content-type-name', ({ strapi }) => ({
  // wrap a core action, leaving core logic in place
    async find(ctx) {
      // some custom logic here
      ctx.query = { ...ctx.query, local: 'en' }

      // calling the default core action with super
      const { data, meta } = await super.find(ctx);

      // some more custom logic
      meta.date = Date.now()

      return { data, meta };
    },
  }));

  ```

:::tip Customization tips

- The original controllerâ€™s CRUD actions can be called using `super` (e.g. `super.find()`).
- The `sanitizeInput` and `sanitizeOutput` utilities can be used in Strapi v4 and replace the `sanitizeEntity` utility from v3.

More examples can be found in the [controllers implementation documentation](/developer-docs/latest/development/backend-customization/controllers.md#implementation).
