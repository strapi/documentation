# v4 code migration: Updating the webpack configuration

!!!include(developer-docs/latest/update-migration-guides/migration-guides/v4/snippets/code-migration-intro.md)!!!

::: strapi v3/v4 comparison
In both Strapi v3 and v4, the webpack configuration is customizable.

In Strapi v4, webpack v5 is used, and only `./src/admin/app.js` and the files under the `./src/admin/extensions` folder are being watched by the webpack dev server (see [admin panel customization](/developer-docs/latest/development/admin-customization.md#webpack-configuration) documentation).

:::

::: prerequisites
Webpack plugins and loaders should be upgraded to the latest version before migrating.
:::

To update the [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) configuration to Strapi v4:

1. Rename the `./src/admin/webpack.config.example.js` to `./src/admin/webpack.config.js`.
2. Copy the content of `./admin/admin.config.js` from the Strapi v3 application to `./src/admin/webpack.config.js`.

::: details Example of a webpack configuration file in Strapi v4

```js
// path: ./src/admin/webpack.config.js

'use strict';

// WARNING: the admin panel now uses webpack 5 to bundle the application.

module.exports = (config, webpack) => {
  // Note: we provide webpack above so you should not `require` it
  // Perform customizations to webpack configuration
  config.plugins.push(new webpack.IgnorePlugin(/\/__tests__\//));
  // Important: return the modified configuration
  return config;
};
```
