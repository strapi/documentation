::: tip
Feel free to [join us on Slack](http://slack.strapi.io) and ask questions about the migration process.
:::

<br>

## Getting started

Install Strapi `alpha.19` globally on your computer. To do so run `npm install strapi@3.0.0-alpha.19 -g`.

When it's done, generate a new empty project `strapi new myNewProject` (don't pay attention to the database configuration).

<br>

## Update node modules

Update the Strapi's dependencies version (move Strapi's dependencies to `3.0.0-alpha.19` version) of your project.

Run `npm install strapi@3.0.0-alpha.19 --save` to update your strapi version.

<br>

## Update the Admin

::: tip
If you performed updates in the Admin, you will have to manually migrate your changes.
:::

Delete your old admin folder and replace it with the new one.

<br>

## Update the Plugins

::: tip
If you did a custom update on one of the plugins, you will have to manually migrate your update.
:::

Copy the fields and relations you had in your `/plugins/users-permissions/models/User.settings.json` and `/plugins/users-permissions/config/jwt.json` file in the new one.

Then, delete your old `plugins` folder and replace it with the new one.

## Production environment

If you deploy your application on a server that you don't have write file access you will have to update your procution config file.
In `config/environments/production/server.json` file you have to add `production` key with `true` as value.

```
{
  ...
  "port": "${process.env.PORT || 1337}",
  "production": true,
  "proxy": {
    "enabled": false
  },
  ...
}
```

<br>

That's all, you have now upgraded to Strapi `alpha.19`.
