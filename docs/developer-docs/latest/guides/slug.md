# Create a slug system

!!!include(developer-docs/latest/guides/snippets/guide-not-updated.md)!!!

This guide will explain how to create a slug system for a Post, Article or any Content Type you want.

## Create attributes

To start building your slug system you need a `string` field as a **base** for your slug, in this example we will use `title`.

You will also need another `string` field that contains the slugified value of your `title`, in this case we will use `slug`.

## Configure the layout for the content editor

Let's configure the layout of the **edit page** to make it more user friendly for the content editor.

- Click on the **Article** link in the left menu.
- Then on the `+ Add New Article` button.
- And finally on the `Configure the layout` button.

Here we will be able to setup the `slug` field.

- Click on the `slug` field.
- At the bottom of the page, edit the **placeholder** value to `Generated automatically based on the title`.
- And click **OFF** for **Editable field** option.
- Don't forget to save your updates.

## Auto create/update the `slug` attribute

For that you will have to install `slugify` node module in your application.

When it's done, you have to update the lifecycle of the **Article** Content Type to auto complete the `slug` field.

**Path â€”** `./src/api/[api-name]/content-types/[content-type-name]/lifecycles.js`

```js
const slugify = require('slugify');

module.exports = {

  async beforeCreate(event) {
    if (event.params.data.title) {
      event.params.data.slug = slugify(event.params.data.title, { lower: true });
    }
  },
  async beforeUpdate(event) {
    if (event.params.data.title) {
      event.params.data.slug = slugify(event.params.data.title, { lower: true });
    }
  },
};
```

## Fetch article by `slug`

Then you will be able to fetch your **Articles** by this slug.

You will be able to find your articles by slug with this request `GET /articles?filters[slug]=my-article-slug`
