# Amazon AWS

This is a step-by-step guide for deploying a Strapi project to [Amazon AWS EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/). This guide will connect to an [Amazon AWS RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) for managing and hosting the database. Optionally, this guide will show you how to connect host and serve images on [Amazon AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/).

Prior to starting this guide, you should have created a [Strapi project](/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/quick-start.md), to use for deploying on AWS. And have read through the [configuration](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/deployment.md#application-configuration) section.

### Amazon AWS Install Requirements and creating an IAM non-root user

- You must have an [Amazon AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/free) account before doing these steps.

Best practices for using **AWS Amazon** services state to not use your root account user and to use instead the [IAM (AWS Identity and Access Management) service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/introduction.html). Your root user is therefore only used for a very few [select tasks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tasks-that-require-root.html). For example, for **billing**, you create an **Administrator user and Group** for such things. And other, more routine tasks are done with a **regular IAM User**.

#### 1. Follow these instructions for [creating your Administrator IAM Admin User and Group](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/getting-started_create-admin-group.html)

- Login as **root**.
- Create **Administrator** role.

#### 2. Next, create a **regular user** for the creation and management of your Strapi project

- Copy your **IAM Users sign-in link** found here: [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home) and then log out of your **root user** and log in to your **administrator** user you just created.
- Return to the IAM Console by `searching for IAM` and clicking or going here: [IAM Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home).
- Click on `Users`, in the left hand menu, and then click `Add User`:
  1. In the **Set user details** screen:
  - Provide a **User name**.
  - **Access Type**: Check both `Programmatic access` and `AWS Management Console access`.
  - `Autogenerate a password` or click `Custom password` and provide one.
  - **OPTIONAL:** For simplicity, `uncheck` the **Require password reset**.
  - Click `Next: Permissions`.
  2. In the **Set Permissions** screen, do the following:
  - Click `Create group`, name it, e.g. `Developers`, and then choose appropriate policies under **Policy Name**:
    - search for `ec2` and check `AmazonEC2FullAccess`
    - search for `RDS` and check `AmazonRDSFullAccess`
    - search for `s3` and check `AmazonS3FullAccess`
    - Click `Create group`
  - Click to `Add user to group` and check the `Developers` group, to add the new user.
  - Click `Next: Tags`.
  3. **Add tags** (optional)
  - This step is **optional** and based on your workflow and project scope.
  - Click `Next: Review`.
  4. **Review**
  - Review the information and ensure it is correct. Use `Previous` to correct anything.
  - Click `Create user`.
  5. **Success** - These are very **IMPORTANT CREDENTIALS**
     _If you do not do these steps you will have to reset your `Access key ID` and `Secret access key` later._
  - `Download the .csv file` and store it in a safe place. This contains the user name, login link, Access key ID and Secret access key.
  - **OPTIONAL:** Add these credentials to your \*Password manager\*\*.
  - Click on the `AWS Management Console Access sign-in link`. This will log you out of `Administrator`.

#### 3. `Log into` your **AWS Management Console** as your `regular user`

You may now proceed to the next steps.

#### Additional IAM User Resources

- [IAM Best Practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/best-practices.html).
- [Instructions to reset Access key ID and Secret access key](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html).

### Launch an EC2 virtual machine

Amazon calls a virtual private server, a **virtual server** or **Amazon EC2 instance**. To use this service you will `Launch Instance`. In this section, you will **establish IAM credentials**, **launch a new instance** and **set-up primary security rules**.

#### 1. From your **AWS Management Console** and as your **_regular_** user

- `Find Services`, search for `ec2` and click on `EC2, Virtual Servers in the Cloud`

#### 2. **Select Appropriate Region**

In the top menu, near your IAM Account User name, select, from the dropdown, the most appropriate region to host your Strapi project. For example, `US East (N.Virginia)` or `Asia Pacific (Hong Kong)`. You will want to remember this region for configuring other services on AWS and serving these services from the same region.

#### 3. Click on the blue `Launch Instance` button

- `Select` **Ubuntu Server 18.04 LTS (HVM), SSD Volume Type**
- Ensure `General purpose` + `t2.small` is `checked`.
  ::: tip
  `t2.small` is the smallest instance type in which Strapi runs. `t2.nano` and `t2.micro` **DO NOT** work. At the moment, deploying the Strapi Admin interface requires more than 1g of RAM. Therefore, **t2.small** or larger instance is needed.
  :::
- Click the grey `Next: Configure Instance Details` and `Next: Add Storage`
- In the **Step 4: Add Storage** verify the `General Purpose SSD (gp2)`, then click `Next: Add tags`.
- In the **Step 5: Add Tags**, add tags to suit your project or leave blank, then click `Next: Configure Security Group`.
- In the **Step 6: Configure Security Group**, configure the `security settings` as follows:
  - **Assign a security group:** Check as `Create a new security group`
  - **Security group name:** Name it, e.g. `strapi`
  - **Description:** Write a short description, e.g. `strapi instance security settings`
  - You should have a rule: **Type:** `SSH`, **Protocol:** `TCP`, **Port Range** `22`, **Source:** `0.0.0.0/0` (all IP addresses). If not, add it.
  - Click the grey `Add rule` to add each of these rules:
    - **Type:** `SSH`, **Protocol:** `TCP`, **Port Range** `22`, **Source:** `::/0`
    - **Type:** `HTTP`, **Protocol:** `TCP`, **Port Range** `80`, **Source:** `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`
    - **Type:** `HTTPS`, **Protocol:** `TCP`, **Port Range** `443`, **Source:** `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`
    - **Type:** `Custom TCP Rule`, **Protocol:** `TCP`, **Port Range** `1337`, **Source:** `0.0.0.0/0` **Description:** `Strapi for Testing Port`
      These rules are basic configuration and security rules. You may want to tighten and limit these rules based on your own project and organizational policies.
      ::: tip
      After setting up your Nginx rules and domain name with the proper aliases, you will need to delete the rule regarding port 1337 as this is for testing and setting up the project - **not for production**.
      :::
- Click the blue `Review and Launch` button.
- Review the details, in the **Step 7: Review Instance Launch**, then click the blue `Launch` button. Now, you need to **select an existing key pair** or **create a new key pair**. To create a new key pair, do the following:
  - Select the dropdown option `Create a new key pair`.
  - Name your the key pair name, e.g. `ec2-strapi-key-pair`
    ::: warning
    Download the **private key file** (.pem file). This file is needed, so note where it was downloaded.
    :::
  - After downloading the file, click the blue `Launch Instances` button.

Your instance is now running. Continue to the next steps.

### Install a PostgreSQL database on AWS RDS

Amazon calls their database hosting services **RDS**. Multiple database options exist and are available. In this guide, **PostgreSQL** is used as the example, and the steps are similar for each of the other database that are supported by Strapi. (**MySQL**, **MongoDB**, **PostgreSQL**, **MariaDB**, **SQLite**). You will set-up an **RDS instance** to host your `postgresql` database.

::: tip
**Amazon RDS** does **NOT** have a completely free evaluation tier. After finishing this guide, if you are only testing, please remember to [delete the database](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_DeleteInstance.html). Otherwise, you will incur charges.
:::

#### 1. Navigate to the `AWS RDS Service`

In the top menu, click on `Services` and do a search for `rds`, click on `RDS, Managed Relational Database Service`.

#### 2. Select your region

In the top menu bar, select the region that is the same as the EC2 instance, e.g. `EU (Paris)` or `US East (N. Virgina)`.

#### 3. Create the database

Click the orange `Create database` button.
Follow these steps to complete installation of a `PostgreSQL` database:

- **Engine Options:** Click on `PostgreSQL`, version **PostgreSQL 10.x-R1**
- **Templates:** Click on `Free Tier`.
- **Settings**
  - **DB instance identifier** Give a name to your database, e.g. `strapi-database`
  - **Credential Settings**: This is your `psql` database _username_ and _password_.
    - **Master username:** Keep as `postgres`, or change (optional)
    - `Uncheck` _Auto generate a password_, and then type in a new secret password.
- **Connectivity**, and **Additional connectivity configuration**: Set `Publicly accessible` to `Yes`.
- **OPTIONAL:** Review any further options (**DB Instance size**, **Storage**, **Connectivity**), and modify to your project needs.
- You need to give you Database a name. Under **Additional configuration**:
  - **Additional configuration**, and then **Initial database name:** Give your database a name, e.g. `strapi`.
- Review the rest of the options and click the orange, `Create database` button.

After a few minutes, you may refresh your page and see that your database has been successfully created.

### Configure S3 for image hosting

Amazon calls cloud storage services **S3**. You create a **bucket**, which holds the files, images, folders, etc... which then can be accessed and served by your application. This guide will show you how to use **Amazon S3** to host the images for your project.

#### 1. Navigate to the `Amazon S3`

In the top menu, click on `Services` and do a search for `s3`, click on `Scalable storage in the cloud`.

#### 2. Create the bucket

Click on the blue `Create bucket` button:

- Give your bucket a unique name, under **Bucket name**, e.g. `my-project-name-images`.
- Select the most appropriate region, under **Region**, e.g. `EU (Paris)` or `US East (N. Virgina)`.
- Click `Next`.
- Configure any appropriate options for your project in the **Configure Options** page, and click `next`.
- Under **Block public access**:
  - Uncheck `Block all public access` and set the permissions as follows:
    - `Uncheck` Block new public ACLs and uploading public objects (Recommended)
    - `Uncheck` Block public access to buckets and objects granted through any access control lists (ACLs)
    - `Check` Block public access to buckets and objects granted through new public bucket policies
    - `Check` Block public and cross-account access to buckets and objects through any public bucket policies
  - Select `Do not grant Amazon S3 Log Delivery group write access to this bucket`.
- Click `Next`.
- **Review** and click `Create bucket`.

### Configure EC2 as a Node.js server

You will set-up your EC2 server as a Node.js server. Including basic configuration and Git.

You will need your **EC2** ip address:

- In the `AWS Console`, navigate to the `AWS EC2`. In the top menu, click on `Services` and do a search for `ec2`, click on `Virtual Servers in the cloud`.
- Click on `1 Running Instance` and note the `IPv4 Public OP` address. E.g. `34.182.83.134`.

#### 1. Setup the `.pem` file

- You downloaded, in a previous step, your `User` .pem file. e.g. `ec2-strapi-key-pair.pem`. This needs to be included in each attempt to `SSH` into your `EC2 server`. Move your `.pem` file to `~/.ssh/`, follow these steps:
- On your local machine, navigate to the folder that contains your .pem file. e.g. `downloads`
- Move the .pem file to `~/.ssh/` and set file permissions:
  `Path:./path-to/.pem-file/`

```bash
mv ec2-strapi-key-pair.pem ~/.ssh/
chmod 400 ~/.ssh/ec2-strapi-key-pair.pem
```

#### 2. Log in to your server as the default `ubuntu` user:

::: tip
In the future, each time you log into your `EC2` server, you will need to add the path to the .pem file, e.g. `ssh -i ~/.ssh/ec2-strapi-key-pair.pem ubuntu@12.123.123.11`.
:::

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/ec2-strapi-key-pair.pem ubuntu@12.123.123.11

Welcome to Ubuntu 18.04.2 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-1032-aws x86_64)

...

To run a command as administrator (user "root"), use "sudo <command>".
See "man sudo_root" for details.

ubuntu@ip-12.123.123.11:~$

```

#### 3. Install **Node.js** with **npm**:

Strapi currently supports `Node.js v12.x.x`. The following steps will install Node.js onto your EC2 server.

```bash
cd ~
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
...
sudo apt-get install nodejs
...
node -v && npm -v
```

The last command `node -v && npm -v` should output two versions numbers, eg. `v12.x.x, 6.x.x`.

#### 4. Create and change npm's default directory.

The following steps are based on [how to resolve access permissions from npmjs.com](https://docs.npmjs.com/resolving-eacces-permissions-errors-when-installing-packages-globally):

- Create a `.npm-global` directory and set the path to this directory for `node_modules`

```bash
cd ~
mkdir ~/.npm-global
npm config set prefix '~/.npm-global'
```

- Create (or modify) a `~/.profile` file and add this line:

```bash
sudo nano ~/.profile
```

Add these lines at the bottom of the `~/.profile` file.

```ini
# set PATH so global node modules install without permission issues
export PATH=~/.npm-global/bin:$PATH
```

- Lastly, update your system variables:

```bash
source ~/.profile
```

You are now ready to continue to the next section.

### Install and Configure Git versioning on your server

A convenient way to maintain your Strapi application and update it during and after initial development is to use [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). In order to use Git, you will need to have it installed on your EC2 instance. EC2 instances should have Git installed by default, so you will first check if it is installed and if it is not installed, you will need to install it.

The next step is to configure Git on your server.

#### 1. Check to see if `Git` is installed

If you see a `git version 2.x.x` then you do have `Git` installed. Check with the following command:

```bash
git --version
```

#### 2. **OPTIONAL:** Install Git.

::: tip
Only do if _not installed_, as above. Please follow these directions on [how to install Git on Ubuntu 18.04](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
:::

#### 3. Configure the global **username** and **email** settings: [Setting up Git - Your Identity](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

After installing and configuring Git on your EC2 instance. Please continue to the next step.

### Prepare and clone Strapi project to server

These instructions assume that you have already created a **Strapi** project, and have it in a **GitHub** repository.

You will need to update the `database.json` file to configure Strapi to connect to the `RDS` database. And you will need to install an npm package called `pg` locally on your development server.
::: tip
The `pg` package install is only necessary if you are using **PostgresSQL** as your database.
:::

#### 1. Install `pg` in your Strapi project.

On your development machine, navigate to your Strapi project root directory:
`Path: ./my-project/`

```bash
npm install pg
```

#### 2. Edit the `./config/database.js` file.

Copy/paste the following:

`Path: ./my-project/config/database.js`:

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  defaultConnection: 'default',
  connections: {
    default: {
      connector: 'bookshelf',
      settings: {
        client: 'postgres',
        host: env('DATABASE_HOST', '127.0.0.1'),
        port: env.int('DATABASE_PORT', 5432),
        database: env('DATABASE_NAME', 'strapi'),
        username: env('DATABASE_USERNAME', ''),
        password: env('DATABASE_PASSWORD', ''),
      },
      options: {
        ssl: false,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

#### 3. Install the **Strapi AWS S3 Upload Provider**:

Path: `./my-project/`.

```bash
npm install strapi-provider-upload-aws-s3
```

To enable and configure the provider, create or edit the file at `./config/plugins.js`.

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  upload: {
    provider: 'aws-s3',
    providerOptions: {
      accessKeyId: env('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID'),
      secretAccessKey: env('AWS_ACCESS_SECRET'),
      region: env('AWS_REGION'),
      params: {
        Bucket: env('AWS_BUCKET_NAME'),
      },
    },
  },
});
```

Checkout the documentation about using an upload provider [here](/developer-docs/latest/development/plugins/upload.md#using-a-provider).

#### 4. Push your local changes to your project's GitHub repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'Installed pg, aws-S3 upload provider and updated the config files'
git push
```

#### 5. Deploy from GitHub

You will next deploy your Strapi project to your EC2 instance by **cloning it from GitHub**.

From your terminal and logged into your EC2 instance as the `ubuntu` user:

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/your-name/your-project-repo.git
```

Next, navigate to the `my-project` folder, the root for Strapi. You will need to run `npm install` to install the packages for your project.

`Path: ./my-project/`

```bash
cd ./my-project/
npm install
NODE_ENV=production npm run build
```

Next, you need to install **PM2 Runtime** and configure the `ecosystem.config.js` file

#### 6. Install **PM2 Runtime**

[PM2 Runtime](https://pm2.keymetrics.io) allows you to keep your Strapi project alive and to reload it without downtime.

Ensure you are logged in as a **non-root** user. You will install **PM2** globally:

```bash
npm install pm2@latest -g
```

Now, you will need to configure an `ecosystem.config.js` file. This file will set `env` variables that connect Strapi to your database. It will also be used to restart your project whenever any changes are made to files within the Strapi file system itself (such as when an update arrived from Github). You can read more about this file [here](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/application-declaration/).

- You will need to open your `nano` editor and then `copy/paste` the following:

```bash
cd ~
pm2 init
sudo nano ecosystem.config.js
```

- Next, replace the boilerplate content in the file, with the following:

```js
module.exports = {
  apps: [
    {
      name: 'your-app-name',
      cwd: '/home/ubuntu/my-project',
      script: 'npm',
      args: 'start',
      env: {
        NODE_ENV: 'production',
        DATABASE_HOST: 'your-unique-url.rds.amazonaws.com', // database Endpoint under 'Connectivity & Security' tab
        DATABASE_PORT: '5432',
        DATABASE_NAME: 'strapi', // DB name under 'Configuration' tab
        DATABASE_USERNAME: 'postgres', // default username
        DATABASE_PASSWORD: 'Password',
        AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: 'aws-access-key-id',
        AWS_ACCESS_SECRET: 'aws-access-secret', // Find it in Amazon S3 Dashboard
        AWS_REGION: 'aws-region',
        AWS_BUCKET_NAME: 'my-project-bucket-name',
      },
    },
  ],
};
```

You can also set your environment variables in a `.env` file in your project like so:

```
DATABASE_HOST=your-unique-url.rds.amazonaws.com
DATABASE_PORT=5432
DATABASE_NAME=strapi
DATABASE_USERNAME=postgres
DATABASE_PASSWORD=Password
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=aws-access-key-id
AWS_ACCESS_SECRET=aws-access-secret
AWS_REGION=aws-region
AWS_BUCKET_NAME=my-project-bucket-name
```

We recommend you continue setting the `NODE_ENV` variable in the `ecosystem.config.js` file.

Use the following command to start `pm2`:

```bash
cd ~
pm2 start ecosystem.config.js
```

Your Strapi project should now be available on `http://your-ip-address:1337/`.

::: tip
Earlier, `Port 1337` was allowed access for **testing and setup** purposes. After setting up **NGINX**, the **Port 1337** needs to have access **denied**.
:::

#### 7. Configure **PM2 Runtime** to launch project on system startup.

Follow the steps below to have your app launch on system startup.

::: tip
These steps are based on the [PM2 Runtime Startup Guide](https://pm2.keymetrics.io/docs/usage/startup/#startup-script-generator).
:::

- Generate and configure a startup script to launch PM2, it will generate a Startup Script to copy/paste, do so:

```bash
$ cd ~
$ pm2 startup systemd

[PM2] Init System found: systemd
[PM2] To setup the Startup Script, copy/paste the following command:
sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u your-name --hp /home/your-name
```

- Copy/paste the generated command:

```bash
$ sudo env PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin /usr/lib/node_modules/pm2/bin/pm2 startup systemd -u your-name --hp /home/your-name

[PM2] Init System found: systemd
Platform systemd

. . .


[PM2] [v] Command successfully executed.
+---------------------------------------+
[PM2] Freeze a process list on reboot via:
   $ pm2 save

[PM2] Remove init script via:
   $ pm2 unstartup systemd
```

- Next, `Save` the new PM2 process list and environment.

```bash
pm2 save

[PM2] Saving current process list...
[PM2] Successfully saved in /home/your-name/.pm2/dump.pm2

```

- **OPTIONAL**: You can test to see if the script above works whenever your system reboots with the `sudo reboot` command. You will need to login again with your **non-root user** and then run `pm2 list` and `systemctl status pm2-ubuntu` to verify everything is working.

### Create you first Administrator user

The next steps will create an Administrator user on the strapi AWS instance.

#### 1. Locate your `IPv4 Public IP`:

- Login as your regular user to your `EC2 Dashboard`
- Click on `1 Running Instances`.
- Below, in the **Description** tab, locate your **IPv4 Public IP**

#### 2. Next, create your **Administrator** user, and login to Strapi:

- Go to `http://your-ip-address:1337/`
- Complete the registration form.
- Click `Ready to Start`

### Set up a webhook

Providing that your project is set-up on GitHub, you will need to configure your **Strapi Project Repository** with a webhook. The following article provides additional information to the steps below: [GitHub Creating Webhooks Guide](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/).

- You will need to access the `Settings` tab for your `Strapi Project Repository`:

  1. Navigate and click to `Settings` for your repository.
  2. Click on `Webhooks`, then click `Add Webhook`.
  3. The fields are filled out like this:
     - Payload URL: Enter `http://your-ip-address:8080`
     - Content type: Select `application/json`
     - Which events would you like to trigger this webhook: Select `Just the push event`
     - Secret: Enter `YourSecret`
     - Active: Select the checkbox
  4. Review the fields and click `Add Webhook`.

- Next, you need to create a `Webhook Script` on your server. These commands create a new file called `webhook.js` which will hold two variables:

```bash
cd ~
mkdir NodeWebHooks
cd NodeWebHooks
sudo nano webhook.js
```

- In the `nano` editor, copy/paste the following script, but make sure to replace `your_secret_key` and `repo` with the values that correspond to your project, then save and exit.

(This script creates a variable called `PM2_CMD` which is used after pulling from GitHub to update your project. The script first changes to the home directory and then runs the variable `PM2_CMD` as `pm2 restart strapi`. The project uses the `ecosystem.config.js` as the point of starting your application.)

```js
var secret = 'your_secret_key'; // Your secret key from Settings in GitHub
var repo = '~/path-to-strapi-root-folder/'; // path to the root of your Strapi project on server

const http = require('http');
const crypto = require('crypto');
const exec = require('child_process').exec;

const PM2_CMD = 'cd ~ && pm2 startOrRestart ecosystem.config.js';

http
  .createServer(function(req, res) {
    req.on('data', function(chunk) {
      let sig =
        'sha1=' +
        crypto
          .createHmac('sha1', secret)
          .update(chunk.toString())
          .digest('hex');

      if (req.headers['x-hub-signature'] == sig) {
        exec(`cd ${repo} && git pull && ${PM2_CMD}`, (error, stdout, stderr) => {
          if (error) {
            console.error(`exec error: ${error}`);
            return;
          }
          console.log(`stdout: ${stdout}`);
          console.log(`stderr: ${stderr}`);
        });
      }
    });

    res.end();
  })
  .listen(8080);
```

- Allow the port to communicate with outside web traffic for `port 8080`:
  - Within your **AWS EC2** dashboard:
    - In the left hand menu, click on `Security Groups`,
    - Select with the checkbox, the correct `Group Name`, e.g. `strapi`,
    - At the bottom of the screen, in the **Inbound** tab, click `Edit`, and then `Add Rule`:
      - Type: `Custom TCP`
      - Protocol: `TCP`
      - Port Range: `8080`
      - Source: `Custom` `0.0.0.0/0, ::/0`
    - Then `Save`

Earlier you setup `pm2` to start the services (your **Strapi project**) whenever the **EC2 instance** reboots or is started. You will now do the same for the `webhook` script.

- Install the webhook as a `Systemd` service

  - Run `echo $PATH` and copy the output for use in the next step.

```
cd ~
echo $PATH

/home/your-name/.npm-global/bin:/home/your-name/bin:/home/your-name/.local/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```

- Create a `webhook.service` file:

```bash
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/webhook.service
```

- In the `nano` editor, copy/paste the following script, but make sure to replace `ubuntu` **in two places** if you changed the default `ubuntu` user, and `paste the $PATH` from above.

```bash
[Unit]
Description=Github webhook
After=network.target

[Service]
Environment=PATH=/PASTE-PATH_HERE #path from echo $PATH (as above)
Type=simple
User=ubuntu #replace with your name, if changed from default ubuntu user
ExecStart=/usr/bin/nodejs /home/ubuntu/NodeWebHooks/webhook.js #replace with your name, if changed from default ubuntu user
Restart=on-failure

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

- Enable and start the new service so it starts when the system boots:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable webhook.service
sudo systemctl start webhook
```

- Check the status of the webhook:

```bash
sudo systemctl status webhook
```

- You may test your **webhook** by following the instructions [here](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-node-js-and-github-webhooks-to-keep-remote-projects-in-sync#step-4-testing-the-webhook).

### Further steps to take

- You can **add a domain name** or **use a subdomain name** for your Strapi project, you will need to [install NGINX](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/admin-guide/installing-nginx/installing-nginx-open-source/) and [configure it](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/nodejs-platform-proxy.html).
  ::: tip
  After setting up **NGINX**, for security purposes, you need to disable port access on `Port 1337`. You may do this easily from your **EC2 Dashboard**. In `Security Groups` (lefthand menu), click the checkbox of the group, eg. `strapi`, and below in the `inbound` tab, click `Edit`, and delete the rule for `Port Range` : `1337` by click the `x`.
  :::
- To **install SSL**, you will need to [install and run Certbot by Let's Encrypt](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/using.html).

- Set-up [Nginx with HTTP/2 Support](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-nginx-with-http-2-support-on-ubuntu-18-04) for Ubuntu 18.04.

Your `Strapi` project has been installed on an **AWS EC2 instance** using **Ubuntu 18.04**.
