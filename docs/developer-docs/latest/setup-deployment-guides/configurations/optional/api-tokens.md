# API tokens

Authentication strategies in Strapi can either be based on the use of the [Users & Permissions plugin](/user-docs/latest/users-roles-permissions/introduction-to-users-roles-permissions.md) or on the built-in API token feature.

Using API tokens allows executing a request on [REST API](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/database-apis-reference/rest-api.md) endpoints as an authenticated user. 

## Creation

New API tokens are generated from the [admin panel](/user-docs/latest/settings/managing-global-settings.md#managing-api-tokens).

## Usage

When performing a request to Strapi's [REST API](/developer-docs/latest/developer-resources/database-apis-reference/rest-api.md), the API token should be added to the request's `Authorization` header with the following syntax: `bearer your-api-token`.

## Configuration

New API tokens are generated using a salt. This salt is automatically generated by Strapi and stored in `./config/admin.js` as `apiToken.salt`.

The salt can be customized:

- either by updating the string value for `apiToken.salt` in `./config/admin.js` (see [admin panel configuration documentation](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/required/admin-panel.md))
- or by creating an `API_TOKEN_SALT` [environment variable](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/optional/environment.md#strapi-s-environment-variables) in the `.env` file of the project

::: caution
Changing the salt invalidates all the existing API tokens.
