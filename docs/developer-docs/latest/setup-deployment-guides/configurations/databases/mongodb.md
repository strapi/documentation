## Install on Atlas: MongoDB Atlas

Follow these steps to configure a local Strapi project to use a [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) free 512 MB account in production. (Please see [MongoDB Atlas Documentation](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) if you have any questions.)

- You must have already [created your Strapi project using MongoDB](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/databases/mongodb.md#_2-install-strapi-locally-with-mongodb).
- You must have already created a [free MongoDB Atlas account](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas).

### 1. Log in to your account to create a **Project** and a **Cluster**

- First you need to `Create a new Project`.
- Then click `Build a Cluster`, from the options page:
  - Choose **AWS** as your **Cloud Provider & Region**.
  - Select a **Region**. (Note: some **Regions** do not have a _free tier_.)
  - In **Cluster Tier**, select **Shared Sandbox**, _Tier_ `MO`.
  - In **Cluster Name**, name your cluster.
- Click the green `Create Cluster` button. You will get a message that says, "_Your cluster is being created..._"

### 2. Next, click on the `Database Access` in the left menu (under `Overview`):

- Click the green `+ ADD NEW USER` button:
  - Enter a `username`.
  - Enter a `password`.
  - Under `User Privileges` ensure **`Read and write to any database`** is selected. Then click `Add User` to save.

### 3. Then `whitelist` your IP address. Click into `Network Access`, under `Security` in the left menu:

- Click the green `+ ADD IP ADDRESS`

  - Click `ADD CURRENT IP ADDRESS` or **manually** enter in an IP address to `whitelist`.
  - Leave a comment to label this IP Address. E.g. `Office`.
  - Then click the green `Confirm` button.
  - Delete the `0.0.0.0/0` configuration after testing the connection.

  ::: tip
  If for any reason you need to test the configuration or other aspect of your connection to the database, you may want to set back the `Allow Access from Anywhere`. Follow this steps:
  :::

  - Click the green `+ ADD IP ADDRESS`
    - Next add `0.0.0.0/0` in the `Whitelist Entry`. **Note:** In permanent projects you would configure this with the appropriate IP addresses.
    - Leave a comment to label this IP Address. E.g. `Anywhere`.
    - Click `Confirm`. Then wait until the status turns from `Pending` to `Active`.

  ::: tip
  If you are serving you Strapi project from a known IP Address then follow the following steps to `allow Network Access`.
  :::

  - **Manually** enter in an IP address to `whitelist`, for your Strapi server.
  - Leave a comment to label this IP Address. E.g. `Heroku Server`
  - Then click the green `Confirm` button.

### 4. Retrieve database credentials

MongoDB Atlas automatically exposes the database credentials into a single environment variable accessible by your app. To locate it, follow these steps:

- Under `Atlas` in the left-hand, click on `Clusters`. This should take you to your `cluster`. Next, click `CONNECT` and then `Connect Your Application`.
- Under `1. Choose your driver version`, select **DRIVER** as `Node.js` and **VERSION** as `3.6 or later`.
  ::: warning
  You **must** use `Version: 3.6 or later`.
  :::
- This should show a **Connection String Only** similar to this:

`mongodb+srv://username:<password>@cluster0.blah.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority`




::: warning
Please note the `<password>` after your `username`. In this example, after `mongodb+srv://username:`. You will need to replace the `<password>` with the password you created earlier for this user in your **MongoDB Atlas** account.
:::

### 5. Update and replace your existing `/database.js` config file for the appropriate environment (development | production).

Replace the contents of `/database.js` with the following and replace **< password >** with the password of the user of your database you created earlier:

`Path: ./config/database.js`.

:::: tabs

::: tab Uri Method

This method uses the URI string aqcuired from Atlas in step 4.

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  defaultConnection: 'default',
  connections: {
    default: {
      connector: 'mongoose',
      settings: {
        uri: env('DATABASE_URI'),
        srv: env.bool('DATABASE_SRV', true),
        port: env.int('DATABASE_PORT', 27017),
        database: env('DATABASE_NAME'),
      },
      options: {
        authenticationDatabase: env('AUTHENTICATION_DATABASE', null),
        ssl: env.bool('DATABASE_SSL', true),
      },
    },
  },
})

```

`Path: .env`

```
DATABASE_URI=mongodb+srv://username:<password>@cluster0.blah.mongodb.net/myFirstDatabase?retryWrites=true&w=majority
DATABASE_NAME=myFirstDatabase
```


:::

::: tab Combined Method

This method connects via passing individual connection settings.

```js
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  defaultConnection: 'default',
  connections: {
    default: {
      connector: 'mongoose',
      settings: {
        host: env('DATABASE_HOST'),
        srv: env.bool('DATABASE_SRV', true),
        port: env.int('DATABASE_PORT', 27017),
        database: env('DATABASE_NAME'),
        username: env('DATABASE_USERNAME'),
        password: env('DATABASE_PASSWORD'),
      },
      options: {
        authenticationDatabase: env('AUTHENTICATION_DATABASE', null),
        ssl: env.bool('DATABASE_SSL', true),
      },
    },
  },
})

```

`Path: .env`

```
DATABASE_HOST=cluster0.blah.mongodb.net
DATABASE_NAME=myFirstDatabase
DATABASE_USERNAME=admin
DATABASE_PASSWORD=yourpassword
```
