# Installing from CLI

Strapi CLI (Command Line Interface) installation scripts are the fastest way to get Strapi running locally. The following guide is the installation option most recommended by Strapi.

## Preparing the installation

The CLI installation guide requires at least two software prerequisites to be already installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): only LTS versions are supported (version 12.x minimum). Other versions of Node.js may not be compatible with the latest release of Strapi. The 14.x version is most recommended by Strapi.
- [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install) (version 6.x minimum) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install) to run the CLI installation scripts.

A database is also required for any Strapi project. Strapi currently supports the following databases:

::: warning WARNING
Starting from the release of Strapi v4, MongoDB is not supported natively anymore and no connector is available. For more information, please refer to [the official communication on the topic](https://strapi.io/blog/mongo-db-support-in-strapi-past-present-and-future).
:::

| Database   | Minimum version |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| SQLite     | 3               |
| PostgreSQL | 10              |
| MySQL      | 5.6             |
| MariaDB    | 10.1            |
| MongoDB    | 3.6             |

## Creating a Strapi project

::: danger ðŸ¤“ CLI installation options
The following installation guide covers the most basic installation option using the CLI. There are however other options that can be used when creating a new Strapi project:

- Using the `--quickstart` flag at the end of the command to directly create the project in quickstart mode.
- Using the `--template` flag at the end of the command to create a project with pre-made Strapi configurations (see [Templates](templates.md)).

Strapi also offers a starters CLI to create a project with a pre-made frontend application (see [our dedicated blog post](https://strapi.io/blog/announcing-the-strapi-starter-cli)).
:::


1. In a terminal, run the following command:

:::: tabs card
::: tab npm
 ```sh
  npx create-strapi-app my-project
  ```
::: 
::: tab yarn
 ```sh
  yarn create strapi-app my-project
 ```
:::

2. Choose an installation type:
   * `Quickstart (recommended)`, which uses the default database (SQLite)
   * `Custom (manual settings)`, which allows to choose your preferred database

3. When terminal asks `Would you like to use a template?`, type `y` for yes or `n` for no then press Enter.

4. (Templates only) Among the list of use cases, choose one for your Strapi project.

5. (Custom installation type only) Among the list of databases, choose a database for your Strapi project.

6. (Custom installation type only) Name your project's database.

## Running Strapi

To start the Strapi application, run the following command in the project folder:

:::: tabs card
::: tab npm
```bash
npm run develop
```
:::

::: tab yarn
```sh
yarn develop
```
