# Introduction to the Media Library

The Media Library is a Strapi plugin that is always activated by default and cannot be deactivated. It is accessible both when the application is in a development and production environment.

Administrators can access the Media Library from ![ML icon](../assets/icons/media_library.svg) _Media Library_ in the main navigation of the admin panel.

The Media Library displays all assets uploaded in the application, either via the Media Library or the Content Manager when managing a media field.

From the Media Library, it is possible to:

- upload a new asset (1),
- create a new media folder (2),
- sort the assets and folders (3) or set filters (4) to find assets more easily,
- make a textual search (5) to find a specific asset or folder.
