# Managing administrator accounts

Administrators are the users of an admin panel of a Strapi application. Administrator accounts and roles are managed with the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature. It is available in the *Administration panel* section of the Settings interface, accessible from *General > Settings* in the main navigation of the admin panel.

The *Administration panel* section is divided into 2 sub-sections: *Roles* (see [Configuring administrator roles](configuring-administrator-roles.md)) and *Users*.

The *Users* sub-section of *Administration panel* displays a table listing all the administrators of your Strapi application.

From this interface, it is possible to:

- make a textual search (1) to find specific administrators,
- sort the administrator accounts (2) to make it easier to view the list of administrator accounts,
- set filters (2) to find specific administrators,
- create a new administrator account (see [Creating a new account](#creating-a-new-account)),
- delete an administrator account (see [Deleting an account](#deleting-an-account)),
- or access information regarding an administrator account, and edit it (see [Editing an account](#editing-an-account)).

For each administrator listed in the table, their main account information are displayed, including name, email and attributed role. The status of their account is also indicated: active or inactive, depending on whether the administrator has already logged in to activate the account or not.
