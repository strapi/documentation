# Configuring administrator roles

Administrators are the users of an admin panel of a Strapi application. Administrator accounts and roles are managed with the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature. It is available in the *Administration panel* section of the Settings interface, accessible from *General > Settings* in the main navigation of the admin panel.

The *Administration panel* section is divided into 2 sub-sections: *Roles* and *Users* (see [Managing administrators](managing-administrators.md)).

![Administrator roles interface](../assets/users-permissions/administrator_roles.png)

The *Roles* sub-section of *Administration panel* displays all created roles for the administrators of your Strapi application.

From this interface, it is possible to:

- create a new administrator role (see [Creating a new role](#creating-a-new-role)),
- delete an administrator role (see [Deleting a role](#deleting-a-role)),
- or access information regarding an administrator role, and edit it (see [Editing a role](#editing-a-role)).

By default, 3 administrator roles are defined for any Strapi application:

- Author: to be able to create and manage their own content.
- Editor: to be able to create content, and manage and publish any content.
- Super Admin: to be able to access all features and settings. This is the role attributed by default to the first administrator at the creation of the Strapi application.

::: warning IMPORTANT
If you use your Strapi application with the Community Edition (see [Pricing and Plans](https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted)), your use of the RBAC feature will be limited. Only the 3 default roles are available, as you cannot create more roles and cannot delete the default ones. It is however possible to edit them, but to an extent:

- You can only configure permissions for the content-types, but not for the plugins and settings of the Strapi application.
- Configuring permissions in detail is only available for the Enterprise Edition. With the Community Edition, although you can choose which fields of a content type are accessible, these fields are automatically fully accessible with all permissions.
- Custom conditions defined for a specific permission are also only available for the Enterprise Edition.

On the top right side of the *Administration panel > Roles* interface, an **Add new role** button is displayed. It allows to create a new role for administrators of your Strapi application.

To create a new role, click on the **Add new role** button.

Administrator roles can be deleted from the *Administration panel > Roles* interface. However, they can only be deleted once they are no more attributed to any administrator of the Strapi application.

To delete a role:

1. Click on the trash button <Fa-TrashAlt /> on the right side of the role's record.
2. In the deletion window, click on the **Yes, confirm** button to confirm the deletion.

## Editing a role

![Administrator roles edition interface](../assets/users-permissions/administrator_roles-edition.png)

The role edition interface allows to edit the details of an administrator role as well as configure in detail the permissions to all sections of your Strapi application. It is accessible from *Administration panel > Roles* either after clicking on the edit button <Fa-PencilAlt /> on the right side of a role's record, or after clicking on the **Add new role** button (see [Creating a new role](#creating-a-new-role)).

### Editing role's details

The details area of an administrator role editing interface allow to define the name of the role, and to give it a description that should help other administrators understand what the role gives access to.

::: tip ðŸ’¡ TIP
In the top right corner, you can see a counter indicating how many administrators have been attributed the role.
:::

To edit a role's details, follow the instructions from the table below:

| Role details  | Instructions                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Name          | Write the new name of the role in the textbox.                                                                                   |
| Description   | Write the description of the role in the textbox.                                                                                |

### Configuring role's permissions

The permissions area of an administrator role editing interface allows to configure in detail what actions an administrator can do for any part of the Strapi application. It is displayed as a table, split into 4 categories: Collection Types, Single Types, Plugins and Settings.

#### Collection and Single Types

The Collection Types and Single Types categories respectively list all available collection and single types for the Strapi application. For each content type, the administrators can have the permission to perform the following actions: create, read, update, delete and publish.

To configure Collection or Single Types permissions for a role:

1. Go to the Collection Types or Single Types category of the permissions table.
2. Tick the box on the left of the name of the content type to give access to. By default, all actions can be performed for all fields of the content type.
3. (optional - Enterprise Edition only) Untick the action-related boxes to prevent actions of your choice.
4. (optional) Click the name of the content type to display its full list of fields. Untick the field and action-related boxes to prevent access and/or action for the fields of your choice. If the [Internationalization plugin](/user-docs/latest/plugins/strapi-plugins.md#internationalization-plugin) is installed, define also what permissions should be granted for each available locale.
5. Repeat steps 2 to 4 for each content type available to which the role should give access.
6. Click on the **Save** button on the top right corner.

#### Plugins and Settings <BronzeBadge link="https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted"/> <SilverBadge link="https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted"/> <GoldBadge link="https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted" withLinkIcon/>

The Plugins and Settings categories both display a sub-category per available plugin or setting of the Strapi application. Each sub-category contains its own specific set of permissions.

To configure plugins or settings permissions for a role:

1. Go to the Plugins or Settings category of the permissions table.
2. Click on the name of the sub-category which permissions to configure, to display all available permissions.
3. Tick the boxes of the permissions the role should give access to. You can refer to the table below for more information and instructions.

### Setting custom conditions for permissions <BronzeBadge link="https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted"/> <SilverBadge link="https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted"/> <GoldBadge link="https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted" withLinkIcon/>

For each permission of each category, a **Settings** button is displayed. It allows to push the permission configuration further by defining additional conditions for the administrators to be granted the permission. There are 2 default additional conditions:

- the administrator must be the creator,
- the administrator must have the same role as the creator.

::: tip NOTE
Other custom conditions can be available if they have been created beforehand for your Strapi application (see [Role-Based Access Control](/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations.md#role-based-access-control)).
:::

![Custom conditions for administrator role permissions](../assets/users-permissions/administrator_custom-conditions.png)

To set custom conditions:

1. Click on the **Settings** button of the permission already granted for the role.
2. In the *Define conditions* window, each available permission can be customised with a specific condition. Click on the drop-down list related to the permission you want to customise.
3. Define the custom condition for the chosen permission. You can either:
   - Tick the Default option for all available additional conditions to be applied.
   - Click on the arrow button ![icon arrow](../assets/users-permissions/icon_arrowdown.png) to see the available additional conditions and tick only the chosen one(s).
4. Click on the **Apply** button.

::: warning IMPORTANT
Custom conditions can only be set for permissions that have been ticked to be granted for the role. If not, when clicking the **Settings** button, the window that opens will remain empty, as no custom condition option will be available.
