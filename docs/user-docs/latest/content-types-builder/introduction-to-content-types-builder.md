# Introduction to the Content-Types Builder

The Content-Types Builder is a core plugin of Strapi. It is a feature that is always activated by default and cannot be deleted. It is however only accessible when the application is in a development environment.

Administrators can access the Content-Types Builder from _Plugins > Content-Types Builder_ in the main navigation of the admin panel.

From the Content-Types Builder, administrators can create and manage content-types: collection types and single types but also components. All 3 are displayed as categories in the left side of the Content-Types Builder interface. In each category are listed all content-types and components that have already been created, configured and saved.

From each category of the Content-Types Builder, it is possible to:

- click on an existing content-type or component to access it and edit it (see [Editing and deleting content-types](saving-editing-deleting-content-types)),
- or create a new content-type or component (see [Creating content-types](creating-new-content-type)).
