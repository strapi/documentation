- indications on the current status of the plugin:
   - *Compatible with your app*: indicates that the plugin is not installed yet but can be installed on your Strapi application
   - **Already installed**: indicates that the plugin is already installed and available in your Strapi application

::: tip 💡 TIP
Click on the <Fa-ExternalLinkAlt /> icon next to the name of a plugin to be redirected to the plugin package in the Strapi GitHub repository.
