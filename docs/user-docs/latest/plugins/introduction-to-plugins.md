# Introduction to plugins

Strapi is built around different types of plugins. Core plugins are essential for your Strapi application to function, and therefore cannot be deactivated. Pre-installed plugins, such as Internationalization, are installed in a default Strapi application. Additional plugins that extend and customize Strapi applications are available in the [Marketplace](../plugins/installing-plugins-via-marketplace.md).

::: note
Core plugins which include the Content Manager and the Content-type Builder are documented in their own sections of the user guide as they are quite specific (see [Introduction to the Content Manager](../content-manager/introduction-to-content-manager.md) and [Introduction to the Content-type Builder](../content-types-builder/introduction-to-content-types-builder.md)). This Plugins section focuses on how to manage plugins in general and provides documentation for the other, non-core plugins.
