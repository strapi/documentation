# Introduction to plugins

Strapi is built around plugins of different kinds. There are the core plugins which are essential for your Strapi application to function, and therefore cannot be deactivated. But there are also other plugins, that can either be installed by default or not, to add more options and possibilities to your Strapi application.

::: note
Core plugins which include the Content Manager and the Content-Type Builder are documented in their own sections of the user guide as they are quite specific (see [Introduction to the Content Manager](../content-manager/introduction-to-content-manager.md) and [Introduction to the Content-Type Builder](../content-types-builder/introduction-to-content-types-builder.md)). This Plugins section focuses on how to manage plugins in general and provides documentation for the others, non-core plugins.
:::

Plugins are managed, for anything related to installation and deletion, from ![Marketplace icon](../assets/icons/marketplace.svg) _Marketplace_ and ![Plugins icon](../assets/icons/plugins.svg) _Plugins_, both available in the main navigation of the admin panel. Once installed, your plugins are added to the main navigation of the admin panel, from where they are directly accessible.
