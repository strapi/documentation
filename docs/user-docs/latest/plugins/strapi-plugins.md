# List of Strapi plugins

::: warning ðŸš§ This section of the user guide is a work in progress. Stay tuned!
<br>
:::

No matter if they are installed by default, or additional, Strapi plugins allow to expand your application by adding more options and possibilities. All options are documented in their right places throughout the user guide. However, you can use the following documentation as a reference guide to know which Strapi plugins are available, how they work and which options they add to your Strapi application.

## Default plugins

### <img width="28" src="../assets/plugins/icon_i18n-plugin.png"> Internationalization plugin

The Internationalization plugin is installed by default on all Strapi applications running on version 3.6.0 or higher. For lower versions, a migration is needed (see [Update Strapi version](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/update-migration-guides/update-version.html) in the developer documentation), as well as a manual installation of the plugin (see [Installing plugins via the Marketplace](installing-plugins-via-marketplace.md)).

This plugin allows to manage content in different languages, called "locales". With the Internationalization plugin, it is possible to:

- define what locales should be available in the Strapi application,
- define which content-types and fields can be translated in different locales, or should only be available in the default locale,
- translate content and manage it each locale at a time.

The Internationalization plugin impacts several parts of the admin panel. The table below lists all the additional options and settings that are added to a Strapi application once the plugin has been installed.

| Section impacted | Options and settings                                                                                    |
