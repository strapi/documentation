# List of Strapi plugins

This section provides a reference guide to the pre-installed plugins and additional plugins developed by Strapi which are available in the [Marketplace](/user-docs/latest/plugins/installing-plugins-via-marketplace.md). Regardless of the type, plugins are a way to expand the functionality of your Strapi application. Additional documentation on plugins is provided in the relevent sections of the User Guide and the Developer Documention, however, a brief plugin description, how the installed plugin works, and changes to the admin panel is provided below.

::: note
- Some Strapi Starters and Templates might install additional plugins beyond the default plugins listed below.
- Some plugin options are only available with an [Enterprise edition license](https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted), and are marked with  <BronzeBadge link="https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted"/> <SilverBadge link="https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted"/> <GoldBadge link="https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted"/> in this reference guide.

## Pre-installed plugins

### <img width="28" src="../assets/plugins/icon_i18n-plugin.png"> Internationalization plugin

The Internationalization plugin is installed by default on all v4 Strapi applications, but it can be deactivated.

This plugin is used to manage content in different languages, called "locales". With the Internationalization plugin, it is possible to:

- define which locales should be available in the Strapi application,
- define which content-types and fields can be translated in different locales, or should only be available in the default locale,
- translate content and manage each locale individually.

The Internationalization plugin affects several parts of the admin panel. The table below lists all the additional options and settings that are added to a Strapi application once the plugin has been installed.

| Section impacted | Options and settings                                                                                    |

### <img width="28" src="../assets/plugins/icon_up-plugin.png"> Users & Permissions plugin

:::note
[API tokens](/user-docs/latest/settings/managing-global-settings.html#managing-api-tokens) are the preferred method for managing end users. Strapi plans to remove the Users & Permissions plugin from the default installation by the end of September 2022. <!--confirmed with Marco. Probably earlier, update will be needed-->
:::

The Users & Permissions plugin is installed by default on all v4 Strapi applications, but can be deactivated.

This plugin is used to manage end users, who consume the content that is created and managed with a Strapi application and displayed on a front-end application (e.g. website, mobile application, connected device etc.). With the Users & Permissions plugin, it is possible to:

- manage end users accounts, based on the "User" collection type available through the plugin,
- define the available end-user roles and their related permissions,
- manage available providers to enable end users to login through third-party providers,
- configure available email templates aimed at the end users (e.g. password reset, email address confirmation).

The Users & Permissions plugin impacts several parts of the admin panel. The table below lists all the additional options and settings that are added to a Strapi application once the plugin has been installed.

| Section impacted | Options and settings                                                                                    |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Settings         | <ul>Addition of a "Users & Permissions plugin" setting section, which contains 4 sub-sections: Roles (see [Configuring end-user roles](../users-roles-permissions/configuring-end-users-roles.md)), Providers, Email Templates, and Advanced Settings (see [Configuring Users & Permissions plugin](../settings/configuring-users-permissions-plugin-settings.md)). <br> ðŸ‘‰ Path reminder: ![Settings icon](../assets/icons/settings.svg) *Settings > Users & Permissions plugin* </ul> |
| Content-type Builder | <ul>Creation of a default collection type "User" which allows for the management of the end users, the end-user roles and their permissions. This collection type cannot be deleted and the composing fields cannot be edited, but the addition of new fields is possible. </ul> |
| Content Manager | <ul>Addition of the default "User" collection type that allows for the managment of end-user accounts (see [Managing end-user accounts](../users-roles-permissions/managing-end-users.md)). <ul><li>By default, the following fields are available: Username, Email, Password, as well as Confirmed and Blocked as boolean fields.</li> <li>The "User" collection type has a relation established with the "Role" collection type. All end-user accounts must have a designated role: by default, the end user is attributed the end-user role set as default, but that role can be changed via the end-user entries directly in the Content Manager.</li></ul> </ul> |

### <img width="28" src="../assets/plugins/EmailPlugin.png"> Email plugin

The Email plugin allows users to send email from the server or from external providers such as Sendgrid.
