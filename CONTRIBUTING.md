## Pull Requests

The core team reviews community pull requests and either merges, requests changes, or comments and closes the pull request. You can open a documentation pull request by:

- clicking the `Improve this page` link at the bottom of any documentation page to directly edit in GitHub,
- forking the `documentation` repository and working locally.

### Setup and write locally

The following procedure allows you to work locally on the Strapi documentation.

1. Fork the `documentation` repository.
2. Clone your forked `documentation` repository.
    
    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:yourgithubname/documentation.git
    ```
    
3. Enter the `developer-docs` folder to contribute to the [Developer Documentation](https://strapi.io/documentation/developer-docs/latest/getting-started/introduction.html), or the `user-docs` folder to contribute to the [User Guide](https://strapi.io/documentation/user-docs/latest/getting-started/introduction.html).
    
    ```bash
    # developer documentation
    cd documentation/docs/developer-docs
    
    # user documentation
    cd documentation/docs/user-docs
    ```
    
4. Choose the branch from which to work: either `main` for a contribution on the current version of Strapi or `v[x]` for a contribution on a previous version of Strapi.
    
    ```bash
    #current version of Strapi (i.e. v4)
    git checkout main
    
    #previous version of Strapi (e.g. v3)
    git checkout v3
    ```
    
    <aside>
    âœ‹ Previous, non-current versions of the Strapi documentation are only maintained for 6 months after the release of the latest, current version.
    
    </aside>
    
5. From your chosen branch, retrieve the latest modifications to work on an up-to-date branch.
    
    ```bash
    git pull
    ```
    
6. Create your branch, based on either `main` or `v[x]`, to work on your documentation contribution. Make sure your branch name indicates both the type of documentation and the topic.
    
    ```bash
    # developer documentation
    git checkout -b <dev/branch-name>
    
    # user documentation
    git checkout -b <user/branch-name>
    
    ```

7. Run the docs on your computer

  ```bash
    cd docs

    # Install dependencies
    yarn

    # Run user and developer-docs
    yarn dev

    # Run developer-docs only
    yarn dev:dev

    # Run user-docs only
    yarn dev:user

  ```

  The project is now up and running at http://localhost:8080 and you should be able to access it in your browser.

You are now ready to contribute to the Strapi documentation! ðŸš€

### Write technical documentation

The Strapi documentation follows the [Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style). The [Highlights](https://developers.google.com/style/highlights) section provides information on tone, structure, and formatting.

The Strapi [Formatting Style Guide](https://github.com/strapi/documentation/blob/main/formatting_style_guide.pdf) has formatting guidelines and how to implement formatting in markdown files.

When you are finished writing, create a pull request from your forked repository to the original `documentation` repository (see [the GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork) for more information) or use the _Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request_ option if you are using the GitHub web browser interface (see [the GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request)).

âœ‹ Sign the CLA (Contributor License Agreement), directly via GitHub (see [our dedicated blog post](https://strapi.io/blog/switching-from-dco-to-cla) for more information).

### Review and management of pull requests

The pull request review process and timeline are based on the availability of Strapi's Documentation team to handle community contributions. The workflow is:

1. The pull request is assigned to a member of the Documentation team.
2. At least 1 member of the Documentation team will review the pull request for:

- accuracy,
- quality,
- alignment with the documentation scope and roadmap.

3. Reviewers will either approve, ask for changes, or reject the pull request.
4. Accepted pull requests will be merged and deployed as part of the regular documentation deployments on Wednesdays every 2 weeks.

Every documentation deployment is communicated through a message in [the "News" section of the Strapi forum](https://forum.strapi.io/c/news/5).
