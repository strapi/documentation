### Contribution Prerequisites

<!-- TODO Update warning about using yarn when npm v7 is out since it will support yarn.lock files â€” see https://blog.npmjs.org/post/621733939456933888/npm-v7-series-why-keep-package-lockjson.html -->
- You installed the following softwares:
  - [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) at v12 only (Node v13+ are not supported)
  - [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) at v1.2.0+. **Please use yarn**, not npm, as we maintain a `yarn.lock` file instead of `package-lock.json`
- You are familiar with Git.

### Contribution Workflow

<!-- TODO add contrib-docs and link here -->

#### Setting up

1. Fork the `documentation` repository.
2. Clone your forked `documentation` repository.

    ```bash
    # HTTPS
    git clone https://github.com/yourgithubname/documentation.git

    # SSH
    git clone git@github.com:yourgithubname/documentation.git
    ```

3. From the `main` branch, retrieve the latest modifications to work on an up-to-date branch.

    ```bash
    git checkout main
    git pull
    ```

4. Create your own branch. Make sure the name of your branch indicates both the type of documentation and the topic.

    ```bash
    #user documentation
    git checkout -b <user/branch-name>

    #developer documentation
    git checkout -b <dev/branch-name>
    ```

5. Enter in the folder which contains the whole VuePress documentation project.

    ```bash
    cd docs
    ```

6. Make sure all dependencies are installed, then run the server:

    ```bash
    yarn && yarn dev
    ```

#### Writing
We can't provide you specific procedures with step-by-step instructions to write technical documentation. But if you have any question or need help, do feel free to reach us through [our forum](https://forum.strapi.io/).

#### Sharing & reviewing

1. Create a pull request from your forked `documentation` repository to the original `documentation` repository, to share your contribution to the documentation.
2. Wait for your pull request to be reviewed by a Strapi team member.
You do not need to assign anyone. Your pull request will be handled by our team in the next 48 hours (business days).
3. *(optional)* Once the PR has been reviewed, you may have additional fixes to make before it's validated.

Congratulations, and thank you for your contribution!
Once your PR is validated, the Strapi team takes over and make sure your new content will soon be deployed!
