## Before Submitting a Pull Request

The core team will review your pull request and will either merge it, request changes to it, or close it.

**Before submitting your pull request** make sure the following requirements are fulfilled:

- Fork the repository and create your branch from `main`.
- Run `yarn` and `yarn dev` in the specific documentation root. (Please use yarn, not npm as we maintain a yarn.lock file instead of a package-lock.json)

## Development Workflow

<!-- TODO add contrib-docs and link here -->

**Currently WIP**

At the moment we are under a contribution freeze from the community, we will update this guide once we lift the freeze.

## Miscellaneous

### Repository Organization

We have various types of documentation that are maintained on their own:

- **developer-docs**
  - This documentation is tailored for developers and administrators and provide documentation on the technical aspects of Strapi
- **user-docs**
  - This documentation is tailored for users and content-creators of Strapi and outline the user interface and usage of Strapi

We have a few primary branches that are used for different purposes:

- **main**
  - This branch is used by the Strapi to push documentation on new features before they are released, it should not be used for PRs by the community unless instructed to do so by a Strapi team member
- **docs/\***
  - This collection of branches is for current work in progress changes, Strapi team members push our changes here to make PRs against the documentation branch
- **feature/\***
  - This is a collection of branches used as documentation for features currently in development in the main [strapi/strapi](https://github.com/strapi/strapi) repo
