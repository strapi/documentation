# Webhooks

## What is a webhook

Webhook is a construct used by an application to notify other applications that an event occurred. More precisely, webhook is a user-defined HTTP callback. Using a webhook is a good way to tell third party providers to start some processing (CI, build, deployment ...).

The way a webhook works is by delivering information to a receiving application through HTTP requests (typically POST requests).

## How to use

To access the webhook configuration panel, go to `Settings` > `Webhooks`.

## Developer documentation

### User content type webhooks
To prevent from unintentionally sending any user's information to other applications, Webhooks will not work for the User content type.
If you need to notify other applications about changes in the Users collection, you can do so by creating [Lifecycle hooks](./models.md#lifecycle-hooks) inside the file `./extensions/users-permissions/models/User.js`.

### Available configurations

You can set webhook configurations inside the file `./config/server.js`.

- `webhooks`
  - `defaultHeaders`: You can set default headers to use for your webhook requests. This option is overwritten by the headers set in the webhook itself.

**Example configuration**

```js
module.exports = {
  webhooks: {
    defaultHeaders: {
      'Custom-Header': 'my-custom-header',
    },
  },
};
```

### Securing your webhooks

Most of the time, webhooks make requests to public URLs, therefore it is possible that someone may find that URL and send it wrong information.

To prevent this from happening you can send a header with an authentication token. Using the Admin panel you would have to do it for every webhook.
Another way is to define `defaultHeaders` to add to every webhook requests.

You can configure these global headers by updating the file at `./config/server.js`:

:::: tabs

::: tab Simple token

```js
module.exports = {
  webhooks: {
    defaultHeaders: {
      Authorization: 'Bearer my-very-secured-token',
    },
  },
};
```

:::

::: tab Environment variable

```js
module.exports = {
  webhooks: {
    defaultHeaders: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.WEBHOOK_TOKEN}`,
    },
  },
};
```

::::

If you are developing the webhook handler yourself you can now verify the token by reading the headers.
