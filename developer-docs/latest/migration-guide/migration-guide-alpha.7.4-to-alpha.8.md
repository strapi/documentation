<br>

## Getting started

Install Strapi `alpha.8` globally on your computer. To do so run `npm install strapi@3.0.0-alpha.8 -g`.

When it's done, generate a new empty project `strapi new myNewProject` (don't pay attention to the database configuration).

<br>

## Configurations

You will have to update just 1 file: `package.json`

- Edit the scripts section: (only the `setup` line has changed)

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "setup": "cd admin && npm run setup",
    "start": "node server.js",
    "strapi": "node_modules/strapi/bin/strapi.js",
    "lint": "node_modules/.bin/eslint api/**/*.js config/**/*.js plugins/**/*.js",
    "postinstall": "node node_modules/strapi/lib/utils/post-install.js"
  }
}
```

- Edit the Strapi's dependencies version: (move Strapi's dependencies to `3.0.0-alpha.8` version)

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "lodash": "4.x.x",
    "strapi": "3.0.0-alpha.8",
    "strapi-mongoose": "3.0.0-alpha.8"
  }
}
```

## Update the Admin

Delete your old admin folder and replace by the new one.

<br>

## Update the Plugins

Copy these 3 files `/plugins/users-permissions/config/jwt.json`, `/plugins/users-permissions/config/roles.json` and `/plugins/users-permissions/models/User.settings.json` **from your old project** and paste them in the corresponding ones in your new project. It is important to save these files.

Then, delete your old `plugins` folder and replace it by the new one.

That's all, you have now upgraded to Strapi `alpha.8`.
