# Quick Start Guide

Get up and running with the Strapi Release Documentation Analyzer in 5 minutes.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
cd scripts/strapi-release-analyzer
yarn install
```

## Step 2: Configure API Keys

Create a `.env` file at the project root:

```bash
# In the documentation repo root (not in scripts folder)
cd ../..
touch .env
```

Add your keys to `.env`:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

### Getting the Keys

**GitHub Token:**
- Visit: https://github.com/settings/tokens
- Click "Generate new token (classic)"
- Select scope: `public_repo`
- Copy the token starting with `ghp_`

**Anthropic API Key:**
- Visit: https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys  
- Click "Create Key"
- Copy the key starting with `sk-ant-`

## Step 3: Run Your First Analysis

**Basic analysis (markdown only):**
```bash
node scripts/strapi-release-analyzer/index.js https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases/tag/v5.29.0
```

**With PDF generation:**
```bash
node scripts/strapi-release-analyzer/index.js https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases/tag/v5.29.0 --pdf
```

You should see:

## Common Issues

### "GITHUB_TOKEN is not set"
- Make sure `.env` is in the documentation repo root (not in scripts folder)
- Check that the variable name is exactly `GITHUB_TOKEN`

### "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set"  
- Make sure you've added it to the `.env` file
- Verify the key starts with `sk-ant-`

### "Error [ERR_REQUIRE_ESM]"
- Make sure `package.json` has `"type": "module"`
- This should already be configured

### Rate Limiting
- The script respects API rate limits
- It adds 1-second delays between requests
- If you hit limits, wait a few minutes and try again

## Next Steps

- Review the generated report
- Validate suggestions against actual PRs
- Start creating documentation updates based on suggestions
- Integrate into your release workflow
