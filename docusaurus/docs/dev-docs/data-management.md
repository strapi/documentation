# Data Management System

:::callout ðŸš§ Feature under development
The data management system is under development. Not all use cases are covered by the initial release. You can provide feedback about desired functionality on the [Strapi feedback website](https://feedback.strapi.io).
:::

Occasionally, you need to move data out of or into a Strapi instance. This is possible with the data management system which uses CLI-based commands:

- Use [`strapi export`](/dev-docs/data-management/export) to create a data backup, for archive purposes or to import it in another instance.
- Use [`strapi import`](/dev-docs/data-management/import) to restore data from a backup.
- Use [`strapi transfer`](/dev-docs/data-management/transfer) to transfer data between local and/or remote instances.

The following documentation gives explanations and examples for the export, import, and transfer commands, while the [CLI reference documentation](/dev-docs/cli#strapi-export) lists all available flags in a condensed format.

:::caution
Interactive CLI commands do not currently work with the `npm` package manager. For `strapi export` and `strapi import` this means the encryption key prompt is not visible in the CLI. A fix is anticipated by early March 2023. In the meantime consider using the `yarn` package manager.
