# API tokens

<NotV5 />

Authentication strategies in Strapi can either be based on the use of the [Users & Permissions plugin](/user-docs/users-roles-permissions) or on the built-in API token feature.

Using API tokens allows executing a request on [REST API](/dev-docs/api/rest) or [GraphQL API](/dev-docs/api/graphql) endpoints as an authenticated user. 

API tokens can be helpful to give access to people or applications without managing a user account or changing anything in the Users & Permissions plugin.

## Creation

New API tokens are generated from the [admin panel](/user-docs/settings/API-tokens).

## Usage

When performing a request to Strapi's [REST API](/dev-docs/api/rest), the API token should be added to the request's `Authorization` header with the following syntax: `bearer your-api-token`.

:::note
Read-only API tokens can only access the `find` and `findOne` functions.
:::

## Configuration

New API tokens are generated using a salt. This salt is automatically generated by Strapi and stored in `.env` as `API_TOKEN_SALT`.

The salt can be customized:

- either by updating the string value for `apiToken.salt` in `./config/admin.js` (see [admin panel configuration documentation](/dev-docs/configurations/admin-panel))
- or by creating an `API_TOKEN_SALT` [environment variable](/dev-docs/configurations/environment#strapi) in the `.env` file of the project

:::caution
Changing the salt invalidates all the existing API tokens.
