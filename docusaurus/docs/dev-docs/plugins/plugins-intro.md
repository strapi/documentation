# Strapi plugins

Strapi comes with these officially supported plugins:

<DocCardList />

## Automatic plugins discovery

Strapi automatically loads plugins installed with npm. Under the hood, Strapi scans every `package.json` file of the project dependencies, and looks for the following declaration:

```json
"strapi": {
  "kind": "plugin"
}
```

Installed plugins can also be manually enabled or disabled.

## Manual enabling/disabling

To disable a plugin without uninstalling it, switch its `enabled` key to `false` in the [`/config/plugins.js` file](/dev-docs/configurations/plugins).
