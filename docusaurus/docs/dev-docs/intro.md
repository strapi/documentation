# Welcome to the Strapi Developer Docs!

<SubtleCallout title="Developer Docs, User Guide, and Strapi Cloud documentation" emoji="📍">

The documentation for Strapi contains 3 main sections, accessible from the top navigation bar:

- 🧑‍🏫 The **[User Guide](/user-docs/intro)** is all about using Strapi's admin panel.
- ☁️ The **[Strapi Cloud](/cloud/intro)** documentation is about deploying your Strapi application to Strapi Cloud and managing your Strapi Cloud projects and settings.
- 🧑‍💻 The **Developer Docs**, that you're currently reading, contain all the technical information related to the setup, deployment, update, and customization of your Strapi v4 application.

</SubtleCallout>

👉 If you're totally new to **Strapi** <Annotation>**💡 Did you know?**<br />The original purpose of the project was to help Boot**strap** your **API**: that's where the Strapi name comes from and how Strapi was created.<br />Now, Strapi is an **open-source headless CMS** that gives developers the freedom to choose their favorite tools and frameworks and allows editors to manage and distribute their content using their application's admin panel. <br />Based on a plugin system, Strapi is a flexible CMS whose admin panel and API are extensible - and which every part is customizable to match any use case. Strapi also has a built-in user system to manage in detail what the administrators and end users have access to.</Annotation> or if you're a developer who'd like to take the most out of Strapi, the Developer Docs are the place to start! We suggest you to:

1. Head over to the [Quick Start](/dev-docs/quick-start) guide.
2. Continue your journey through the various Developer Docs sections. The ["What you will learn"](#what-you-will-learn) section gives you an overview of the available topics.
