# Query Engine API

:::prerequisites
Before diving deeper into the Query Engine API documentation, it is recommended that you read the following introductions:
- the [backend customization introduction](/dev-docs/backend-customization),
- and the [Content API introduction](/dev-docs/api/content-api).
:::

The Strapi backend provides a Query Engine API to interact with the database layer at a lower level. The Query Engine API should mostly be used by plugin developers and developers adding custom business logic to their applications.

ðŸ‘‰  In most use cases, it's recommended to use the [Entity Service API](/dev-docs/api/entity-service/) instead of the Query Engine API.

## Basic usage

The Query Engine is available through `strapi.db.query`:

```js
strapi.db.query('api::blog.article').findMany({ // uid syntax: 'api::api-name.content-type-name'
  where: {
    title: {
      $startsWith: '2021',
      $endsWith: 'v4',
    },
  },
  populate: {
    category: true,
  },
});
```
