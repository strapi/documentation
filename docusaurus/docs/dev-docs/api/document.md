# Documents

A document in Strapi v5 contains all the variations of a unique piece of content.

A single type contains a unique document, and a collection type can contain several documents.

- A document can have a `published` version and a `draft` **version**.
- Each published or draft version of a document can have multiple **document locales**.<br/>A document locale includes all the content of a given document version for a specific locale.
- A document locale can include multiple **fields**.

<summary>Example:</summary>

[FoodAdvisor](https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor), Strapi's official demo application, is a website listing restaurants around the world. FoodAdvisor's content includes multiple content-types:

- The homepage is a single type, so there's only one document for the homepage.
- "Restaurants" is a collection type, and each restaurant (i.e., each item from the collection type) is represented as a document in Strapi v5.
- The "Biscotte Restaurant" is one of the documents from the "Restaurants" collection type. The "Biscotte Restaurant" document can include all of the following content variations:
  - The "Biscotte Restaurant" document has 2 different versions, a published version that can be seen on the website, and a draft version with updates not ready to be published yet.
  - The published version of the "Biscotte Restaurant" document has 3 document locales: one for English, one for French, and one for Spanish.
  - Each document locale of the "Biscotte Restaurant" document includes multiple fields, such as the name of the restaurant, a short description, and opening hours.
