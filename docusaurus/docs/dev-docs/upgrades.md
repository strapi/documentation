# Upgrades

Strapi periodically releases code improvements through new versions. New Strapi versions are announced in both the terminal and in the administration panel, and [GitHub release notes](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases) list what is new with each new version.

The latest version number of Strapi that was released by the Strapi core team can be found on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@strapi/strapi) or on [GitHub](https://github.com/strapi/strapi/releases).

When a new version of Strapi is released, you might want to upgrade, and the present page serves as an entry point for information about upgrading.

<details>
<summary>How can I find my current Strapi version number?</summary>

You can find the current version number of your Strapi application:

- either in the admin panel, by going to _Settings > Global Settings > Overview_ and looking at the Strapi version number printed in the Details section:

    }}
  />

- or by running `yarn strapi version` or `npm run strapi version` in the terminal, from the folder where your Strapi project is located.
