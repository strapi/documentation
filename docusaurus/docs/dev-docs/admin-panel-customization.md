# Admin panel customization

The front-end part of Strapi is called the admin panel. The admin panel presents a graphical user interface to help you structure and manage the content that will be accessible through the Content API. The admin panel is a React-based single-page application that encapsulates all the features and installed plugins of a Strapi application.

Admin panel customization is a broad topic in Strapi and covers the following aspects:

- Some parts of the admin panel can be customized to better reflect your brand identity or to modify some default Strapi behaviors.
- Some other parts of the admin panel, such as the WYSIWYG editor and the bundler, can be replaced.
- The admin panel can also be extended to add new features or customize the existing user interface.

Depending on what you want to achieve, you might need to update different parts of Strapi, as summarized in the following table:
