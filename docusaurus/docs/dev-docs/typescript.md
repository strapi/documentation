# TypeScript 

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) adds an additional type system layer above JavaScript, which means that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code. In the context of Strapi development, TypeScript allows for a more type-safe codebase for your application, and provides you with a set of tools for automatic type generation and autocompletion.
