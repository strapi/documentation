description: Integrate Strapi with Flutter.

---

# Getting Started with Flutter

This integration guide follows the [Quick Start Guide](/dev-docs/quick-start) and assumes you have you have fully completed the "Hands-on" path. You should be able to consume the API by browsing the URL [http://localhost:1337/api/restaurants](http://localhost:1337/api/restaurants).

If you haven't gone through the Quick Start Guide, the way you request a Strapi API with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) remains the same except that you do not fetch the same content.

## Create a Flutter application

Be sure to have [Flutter installed](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) on your computer.

```bash
flutter create flutterapp
cd flutterapp
```

## Use an HTTP client

We'll use [http](https://pub.dev/packages/http) for making HTTP requests.

- Update the `pubspec.yaml` file with the following:

```yaml
...
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter



  # The following adds the Cupertino Icons font to your application.
  # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.0
  http: ^0.12.2
...
```

- Install your dependencies by running the following command:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

## GET Request to your collection type

Execute a `GET` request on the `restaurant` collection type in order to fetch all your restaurants.

Be sure that you activated the `find` permission for the `restaurant` collection type.

<ApiCall noSideBySide>

<Request title="Example GET request">

```dart
Map<String,String> headers = {
  'Content-Type':'application/json',
  'Accept': 'application/json'
};

var response = await http.get(
  'http://localhost:1337/api/restaurants',
  headers: headers
);

print(response.body)
```
