# Migrating from Strapi v4 to Strapi 5

The latest major version of Strapi is v5. Migrating from Strapi v4 to v5 includes handling breaking changes and specific migration steps.

:::danger
It is currently strongly advised that you refrain from migrating from Strapi v4 to Strapi 5, especially in a production environment.

The beta version of Strapi 5 is not meant to be used in production yet.

The [upgrade tool](/dev-docs/upgrade-tool) and its codemods should automate some parts of the migration from v4 to Strapi 5. Additional information is also given below about breaking changes and dedicated migration resources for specific topics.
