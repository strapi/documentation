## Migration

<MigrationIntro />

### Notes

The following are the main topics to take into account when using the Document Service API instead of the Entity Service API from Strapi v4:

* The Document Service API expects a `documentId` property.<br/>This breaking change also affects the REST and GraphQL APIs (see [the related entry](/dev-docs/migration/v4-to-v5/breaking-changes/use-document-id)).
* The response returned by the `findMany()` function is different in Strapi v4 and Strapi 5:
  - In Strapi v4, the `findMany()` function from the Entity Service API returns a single item for single types.
  - In Strapi 5, the [`findMany()` function from the Document Service API](/dev-docs/api/document-service#findmany) always returns arrays. To get a single item, extract the first item from the returned array, or use [the `findFirst()` function](/dev-docs/api/document-service#findfirst).
* There is no `findPage()` method anymore in Strapi 5 (see [the related breaking change entry](/dev-docs/migration/v4-to-v5/breaking-changes/no-find-page-in-document-service))
* The [Draft & Publish](/user-docs/content-manager/saving-and-publishing-content) feature has been updated in Strapi 5 and this is reflected in the Document Service API:
  - `publicationState` is replaced by `status` (see [the related breaking change entry](/dev-docs/migration/v4-to-v5/breaking-changes/publication-state-removed)).
  - New methods are introduced to handle the updated [Draft & Publish](/user-docs/content-manager/saving-and-publishing-content) feature: [`publish()`](/dev-docs/api/document-service#publish), [`unpublish()`](/dev-docs/api/document-service#unpublish), and [`discardDraft()`](/dev-docs/api/document-service#discarddraft).
  - The `published_at` property can not be used anymore to trigger the publication of content.
* The `delete()` function of the Document Service API returns a list of affected entries (multiple locales can be deleted all at once), while the `delete()` function from Strapi v4 returns only the deleted entry.
* Entity Service decorators can not be used anymore, and [Document Service middlewares](/dev-docs/api/document-service/middlewares) must be used instead.
* The Document Service API does not support file uploads.


### Migration procedure

The migration is partially handled by a codemod when using the [upgrade tool](/dev-docs/upgrade-tool). The [Entity Service API to Document Service API migration reference](/dev-docs/migration/v4-to-v5/guides/from-entity-service-to-document-service) gives additional information about which aspects are handled by the codemod and which use cases require manual migration.
