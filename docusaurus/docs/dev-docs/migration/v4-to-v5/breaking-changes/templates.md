## Breaking change description

<SideBySideContainer>

<SideBySideColumn>

**In Strapi v4**

Templates were npm packages with strict requirements (see [v4 documentation](https://docs-v4.strapi.io/dev-docs/templates)).

</SideBySideColumn>

<SideBySideColumn>

**In Strapi 5**

Templates are now just regular Strapi 5 applications, which can be run on their own.

## Migration

<MigrationIntro />

### Notes

* For additional information about creating a new Strapi application based on an existing template, see the [templates documentation](/dev-docs/templates).
* Creating a Strapi template is now as simple as creating a new Strapi 5 application and adjusting its codebase to your needs.

### Manual migration

Templates in Strapi v4 were only useful if applied on top of a default Strapi application. Strapi 5 templates are now standalone Strapi 5 applications. 

To convert your Strapi v4 template into a usable Strapi 5 template, ensure the template includes all files required for Strapi to work. Your folder containing the v4 template applied on top of a full-blown Strapi application should be enough to be a Strapi 5 template.
