# `publicationState` is removed and replaced by `status`

In Strapi 5, the [Draft & Publish feature](/user-docs/content-manager/saving-and-publishing-content) has been reworked, and the Content API, including [REST API](/dev-docs/api/rest/filters-locale-publication#status), [GraphQL API](/dev-docs/api/graphql), and [Document Service API](/dev-docs/api/document-service) accept a new `status` parameter.

</SideBySideColumn>

<SideBySideColumn>

**In Strapi 5**

`status` is used and accepts the following values:

- `draft` returns the draft version of a document,
- `published` returns the published version of a document.

</SideBySideColumn>

</SideBySideContainer>

## Migration

<MigrationIntro />

### Notes

There are no fallbacks to return by default the published version, and return the draft version if no published version is found.

### Migration procedure

* API calls initiated from the front end (REST API, GraphQL API) that used `publicationState` need to be manually updated.
* If `publicationState` is used in your custom back-end code with the Entity Service API in Strapi v4, a codemod will automatically handle the change for Strapi 5 (see [Entity Service to Document Service migration reference](/dev-docs/migration/v4-to-v5/additional-resources/from-entity-service-to-document-service) for additional details).
