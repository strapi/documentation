## Migration

<MigrationIntro />

### Migration procedure

Users must update their custom code, first sending a [POST call to the Upload API at `/api/upload/`](/dev-docs/plugins/upload#upload-files), then creating an entry with a [POST call to the REST API at `/api`](/dev-docs/api/rest#create-a-document) with the created file id.
