## Migration

<!-- TODO: update this sentence -->
No manual migration is required for the codebase of your Strapi application.
Connection information will probably stay the same as in Strapi v4.

However, to use Strapi v5, you must upgrade your MySQL database to version 8.0 (see additional information in the official [MySQL documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/relnotes/mysql/8.0/en/)).
