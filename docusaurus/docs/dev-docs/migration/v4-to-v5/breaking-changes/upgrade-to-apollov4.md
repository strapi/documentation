## Migration

<MigrationIntro />

### Notes
- Strapi automatically sets `status400ForVariableCoercionErrors: true` in the Apollo Server configuration due to a breaking change introduced by Apollo in v4. This behavior will be the default again in Apollo v5.
- We upgraded the package graphql from ^15 to ^16, and only one version can be included in any project. Therefore, user code or plugins relying on graphql:15 need to use the same version range as Strapi.
- For guidance on upgrading to Apollo Server v4, please refer to the following Manual migration section. For more detailed information, consult the Apollo v4 migration documentation.

### Manual migration

To migrate to Strapi 5:

- Set the `x-apollo-operation-name` header or disable the new protection by adding `csrfPrevention: false` to the GraphQL plugin configuration for multipart messages (file uploads).
- Replace `ApolloError` with `GraphQLError`.
- Remove root level configuration options like `formatResponse` and replace them with plugin hooks in the plugins array.
- Remove the modules configuration option and split it into `typeDefs` and `resolvers`.
- Replace `debug` with `includeStacktraceInErrorResponses`.
