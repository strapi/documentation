## Breaking change description

<SideBySideContainer>

<SideBySideColumn>

**In Strapi v4**

Users could get all of the locales of a single type by passing the `locale=all` parameter to Content API calls. This is not possible on collection types.

</SideBySideColumn>

<SideBySideColumn>

**In Strapi 5**

Getting documents (collection types or single types) in all locales at the same time is not possible anymore. A specific locale value must be passed.

## Migration

### Notes

Additional information on what is possible to do with `locale` in Strapi 5 is available in the [REST API](/dev-docs/i18n#rest), [GraphQL API](/dev-docs/i18n#graphql), and [Document Service API](/dev-docs/api/document-service/locale) reference documentations.

### Manual procedure

Users having custom code sending queries with the `locale=all` parameter should manually update their code to list all available locales then request data for each of these locales one by one.
