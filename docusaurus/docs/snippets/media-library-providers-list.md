By default Strapi provides a provider that uploads files to a local `public/uploads/` directory in your Strapi project. Additional providers are available should you want to upload your files to another location.

The providers maintained by Strapi are the following. Clicking on a card will redirect you to their Strapi Marketplace or npm page:
