# AGENTS.md (Snippets)

Scope
- Applies to all documentation snippets under `snippets/`.

Rules
- Snippets must include language fences and, when applicable, `title=` and `path:` hints.
- Keep examples minimal but runnable; avoid placeholder-only snippets.
- Follow ../../12-rules-of-technical-writing.md for clarity and structure.

Preflight checks before PR
- Regenerate `llms-code.txt` and check that snippet metadata (language/file path) is correctly extracted.
