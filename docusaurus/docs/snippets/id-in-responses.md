:::note
Though it's recommended to target entries by their `documentId` in Strapi 5, entries might still have an `id` field, and you will see it in the returned response. This should ease your transition from Strapi 4. Please refer to the [breaking change entry](/dev-docs/migration/v4-to-v5/breaking-changes/use-document-id) for more details.
