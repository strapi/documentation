Invoices can have any of the following statuses:

- Paid: the payment has been done and the invoice is available, no additional action is required.
- Payment pending: the invoice is not complete or validated yet <!-- need more info: what can the user do if the invoice is in "payment pending"? -->
- Payment due: the paiement didn't go through and needs to be fixed <!-- need more info: is the project automatically suspended? what can the user do? -->
- Not paid: the payment has failed and won't automatically be retried <!-- also need more info potentially -->
- Voided: the invoice has been cancelled.
