:::tip Tip: Hot reloading while developing
In Strapi 5, the server runs in `watch-admin` mode by default, so the admin panel auto-reloads whenever you change its code. This simplifies admin panel and front-end plugins development. To disable this, run `yarn develop --no-watch-admin` (see [CLI reference](/dev-docs/cli#strapi-develop)).
