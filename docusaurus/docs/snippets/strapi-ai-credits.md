:::note Strapi AI credits
Strapi AI includes 1,000 credits per month on the <GrowthBadge noTooltip /> plan, and 10 free credits during the free trial.
Lightweight actions use fewer credits, while more complex ones use more.

You can check your credit usage in the <ExternalLink to="http://localhost:1337/admin/settings/application-infos" text="Settings Overview" /> of the admin panel.
Notifications are sent when your usage reaches 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, and 100% of your monthly allowance. 
<!-- You’ll also receive an email notification at 85%. -->

When your credits run out, you can keep using Strapi AI, with overages billed monthly.
