Strapi takes advantage of the ability of [the `qs` library](https://github.com/ljharb/qs) to parse nested objects to create more complex queries.

Use `qs` directly to generate complex queries instead of creating them manually. Examples in this documentation showcase how you can use `qs`.

You can also use the [interactive query builder](/dev-docs/api/rest/interactive-query-builder) if you prefer playing with our online tool instead of generating queries with `qs` on your machine.
