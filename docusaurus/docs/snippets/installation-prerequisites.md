Before installing Strapi, the following requirements must be installed on your computer:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org): Only [Active LTS or Maintenance LTS versions](https://nodejs.dev/en/about/releases/) are supported (currently `v18` and `v20`). Odd-number releases of Node, known as "current" versions of Node.js, are not supported (e.g. v19, v21).
- Your preferred Node.js package manager:
    - [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/commands/npm-install) (`v6` and above)
    - [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (if using a SQLite database)
