# Welcome to the future ðŸš€<br/>(of Strapi Documentation)!

We are transitioning to a new documentation tool to provide you with better, more inclusive, and more interactive documentation soon.

This beta website contains the current draft of the new documentation.

We will switch this website to be the primary documentation once we reach content parity with the existing, complete Strapi documentation available at [docs.strapi.io](https:/.strapi.io).

To find what you're looking for on this beta website, you can use one of the following methods:

- Click on one of the Developer Docs or User Guide links at the top of the page, then browse from there.
- Use the search bar at the top right to find a specific topic.
- Use the content conversion progress section below for a complete list of existing and upcoming pages.

Once the initial content is fully converted, we will gradually improve the documentation further, for instance, adding a new homepage and more in-depth and interactive content for both beginners and more advanced users. Stay tuned!

In the meantime, we would love to hear your feedback, so [please let us know](https://forum.strapi.io)!
