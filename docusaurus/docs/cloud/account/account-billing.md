# Account billing details

Through the _Profile_ page, accessible by clicking on your profile picture on the top right hand corner of the interface then clicking on **Profile**, you can access the _Billing_ tab.

The _Billing_ tab displays and enables you to modify the billing details and payment method set for the account. This information will by default be reused for every new project created with your Strapi Cloud account.

:::note
The Payment method section can only be accessible once the mandatory fields of the Billing details section have been filled in.
