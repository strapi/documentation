# Welcome to the Strapi Cloud Docs!

This documentation contains all technical documentation related to the setup, deployment, update and customization of your Strapi Cloud account and applications.

## What is Strapi Cloud

Strapi Cloud is a managed content platform built on top of Strapi, the leading open-source headless CMS. It is a fully managed hosting platform that allows you to deploy your Strapi applications in a matter of minutes.

Strapi Cloud enables you to increase your content velocity without having to compromise on customization needs and requirements. Development teams can rely on Strapi Cloud to abstract away the complexity of infrastructure management while keeping your development workflow and extending the core capabilities of Strapi. Content managers can use Strapi Cloud to autonomously manage all types of content and benefit from a complete set of content collaboration, security, and compliance features.

The typical workflow is to create your Strapi (v4.8.2 or later) application locally, extend the application with plugins or custom code, version the application's codebase through your git provider (GitHub or GitLab), and deploy the application in seconds with Strapi Cloud (see [deployment and prerequisites](/cloud/getting-started/deployment#prerequisites)).

## Strapi Community

Strapi Cloud is built on top of open-source Strapi, a community-oriented project with an emphasis on transparency, and Strapi Cloud users can benefit from the years of experience, knowledge, and contributions by the Strapi community as a whole. 

The Strapi team has at heart to share their vision and build the future of Strapi with the Strapi community. This is why the [roadmap](https://feedback.strapi.io) is open: as all insights are very important and will help steer the project in the right direction, any community member is most welcome to share ideas and opinions there.
