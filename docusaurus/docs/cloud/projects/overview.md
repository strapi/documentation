# Projects overview

The *Projects* page displays a list of all your Strapi Cloud projects. From here you can manage your projects and access the corresponding applications.

  }}
/>

Each project card displays the following information:

* the project name
* the current status of the project:
    * *Disconnected*, if the project repository is not connected to Strapi Cloud
    * *Suspended*, if the project has been suspended (refer to [Project suspension](/cloud/getting-started/usage-billing#project-suspension) to reactivate the project)
    * *Incompatible version*, if the project is using a Strapi version that is not compatible with Strapi Cloud

Each project card also displays a ![Menu icon](/img/assets/icons/more.svg) menu icon to access the following options:
* **Visit App**: to be redirected to the application
* **Go to Deployments**: to be redirected to the [*Deploys*](/cloud/projects/deploys) page
* **Go to Settings**: to be redirected to the [*Settings*](/cloud/projects/settings) page
