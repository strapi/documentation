- see its current status:
    - ![Edit icon](/img/assets/icons/CheckCircle.svg) Active: the domain is currently confirmed and active
    - ![Edit icon](/img/assets/icons/Clock.svg) Pending: the domain transfer is being processed, waiting for DNS changes to propagate
    - ![Edit icon](/img/assets/icons/CrossCircle.svg) Failed: the domain change request did not complete as an error occured
- click the ![Edit icon](/img/assets/icons/edit.svg) edit button to access the settings of the domain
- click the ![Delete icon](/img/assets/icons/delete.svg) delete button to delete the domain

### Connecting a custom domain

2. In the window that opens, fill in the following fields:

| Setting name              | Instructions                                                              |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Domain name               | Type the new domain name (e.g. *custom-domain-name.com*)                  |
| Hostname                  | Type the hostname (i.e. address end-users enter in web browser, or call through APIs). |
| Target                    | Type the target (i.e. actual address where users are redirected when entering hostname). |
| Set as default domain     | Tick the box to make the new domain the default one.                      |
