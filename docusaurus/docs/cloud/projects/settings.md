# Project settings

From a chosen project's dashboard, the ![Settings icon](/img/assets/icons/settings.svg) **Settings** button, located in the header, enables you to manage the configurations and settings for your Strapi Cloud project and its environments.

The settings' menu on the left side of the interface is separated into 2 categories: the settings for the entire project and the settings specific to any configured environment for the project.

## Project-level settings

There are 5 tabs available for the project's settings:
- ![General icon](/img/assets/icons/Faders.svg) [*General (project)*](#general),
- ![Environments icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Stack.svg) [*Environments*](#environments),
- ![Billing & Usage icon](/img/assets/icons/CreditCard.svg) [*Billing & Usage*](#billing--usage),
- ![Plans icon](/img/assets/icons/MapTrifold.svg) [Plans](#plans),
- and ![Invoices icon](/img/assets/icons/Invoice.svg) [Invoices](#invoices).

### General (project)

The ![General icon](/img/assets/icons/Faders.svg) *General* tab for the project-level settings enables you to check and update the following options for the project:

- *Basic information*, to see:
  - the name of your Strapi Cloud project, used to identify the project on the Cloud Dashboard, Strapi CLI, and deployment URLs. The project name is set at project creation (see [Project creation](/cloud/getting-started/deployment)) and cannot be modified afterwards.
  - the chosen hosting region for your Strapi Cloud project, meaning the geographical location of the servers where the project and its data and resources are stored. The hosting region is set at project creation (see [Project creation](/cloud/getting-started/deployment)) and cannot be modified afterwards.
  - the app's internal name for the project, which can be useful for debug & support purposes.
- *Connected Git repository*: to change the repository and branch used for your project (see [Modifying git repository & branch](#modifying-git-repository--branch)). Also allows to enable/disable the "deploy on push" option.
- *Delete project*: to permanently delete your Strapi Cloud project (see [Deleting Strapi Cloud project](#deleting-strapi-cloud-project)).

  }}
/>

#### Modifying git repository & branch

The GitHub or GitLab repository, branch and base directory for a Strapi Cloud project are by default chosen at the creation of the project (see [Creating a project](/cloud/getting-started/deployment)). After the project's creation, via the project's settings, it is possible to update the project's repository or switch to another git provider.

:::caution
Updating the git repository could result in the loss of the project and its data, for instance if the wrong repository is selected or if the data schema between the old and new repository doesn't match.
:::

1. In the *Connected git repository* section of the ![General icon](/img/assets/icons/Faders.svg) *General* tab, click on the **Update repository** button. You will be redirected to another interface.
2. (optional) If you wish to not only update the repository but switch to another git provider, click on the **Switch Git provider** button at the top right corner of the interface. You will be redirected to the chosen git provider's authorization settings before getting back to the *Update repository* interface.
3. In the *Update repository* section, fill in the 2 available settings:

    | Setting name    | Instructions                                                             |
    | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Account         | Choose an account from the drop-down list.                               |
    | Repository      | Choose a repository from the drop-down list.                             |

4. In the *Select Git branches* section, fill in the available settings for any of your environments. Note that the branch can be edited per environment via its own settings, see [General (environment)](#general-environment).

    | Setting name    | Instructions                                                             |
    | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Branch          | Choose a branch from the drop-down list.                                 |
    | Base directory  | Write the path of the base directory in the textbox.                     |
    | Auto-deploy     | Tick the box to automatically trigger a new deployment whenever a new commit is pushed to the selected branch. Untick it to disable the option. |

5. Click on the **Update repository** button at the bottom of the *Update repository* interface.
6. In the *Manage repository* dialog, confirm your changes by clicking on the **Relink repository** button.

#### Deleting Strapi Cloud project

You can delete any Strapi Cloud project, but it will be permanent and irreversible. Associated domains, deployments and data will be deleted as well and the subscription for the project will automatically be cancelled.

1. In the *Delete project* section of the ![General icon](/img/assets/icons/Faders.svg) *General* tab, click on the **Delete project** button.
2. In the dialog, select the reason why you are deleting your project. If selecting "Other" or "Missing feature", a textbox will appear to let you write additional information.
3. Confirm the deletion of your project by clicking on the **Delete project** button at the bottom of the dialog.

### Environments <CloudProBadge /> <CloudTeamBadge /> {#environments}

The ![Environments icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Stack.svg) *Environments* tab allows to see all configured environments for the Strapi Cloud project, as well as to create new ones. Production is the default environment, which cannot be deleted. Other environments can be created (depending on the subscription plan for your project) to work more safely on isolated instances of your Strapi Cloud project (e.g. a staging environment where tests can be made before being available on production).

:::tip
Clicking on the **Manage** button for any environment will redirect you to the environment's own general settings, where it is possible to change the Node version, edit the git branches and delete or reset the environment. Please [refer to the dedicated documentation](#general-environment) for more information.
:::

<ThemedImage
  alt="Project overview"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/cloud/environments.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/cloud/environments_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

To create a new environment:

1. Click on the **Add a new environment** button.
2. In the dialog that opens, you can see the price for the new environment and the date of the next invoice.
3. Fill in the available settings:

    | Setting name     | Instructions                                                             |
    | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Environment name | (mandatory) Write a name for your project's new environment.             |
    | Git branch       | (mandatory) Select the right branch for your new environment.            |
    | Base directory   | Write the name of the base directory of your new environment.            |
    | Auto-deploy      | Tick the box to automatically trigger a new deployment whenever a new commit is pushed to the selected branch. Untick it to disable the option. |

4. Click on the **Add environment** button to create your project's new environment. A new deployment will automatically be triggered.

:::caution
If the creation of a new environment fails but you are still charged, try creating the environment again. This time, the environment creation should be successful and you will not be charged a second time. This behaviour is an known issue that should be fixed in the upcoming weeks.
:::

### Billing & Usage

The ![Billing & Usage icon](/img/assets/icons/CreditCard.svg) *Billing & Usage* displays your next estimated payment, all information on the current subscription plan and a detailed summary of the project's and its environments' usage. It also allows you to directly [manage the number of seats](#managing-projects-number-of-seats) and add new environments (please [refer to the documentation in the Environments section](#environments)) for your project.

Through this tab, you also have the possibility to:
- click the **Change** button to be redirected to the ![Plans icon](/img/assets/icons/MapTrifold.svg) *Plans* tab, where you can change you subscription plan ([see related documentation](#plans)),
- click the **Edit** button in order to set a new payment method (see [related documentation](/cloud/account/account-billing)).

:::note
You can attach a dedicated card to your project by choosing the payment method directly from this page. In that way, you can manage your subscriptions with different cards.
:::

:::tip
In the Usage section of the ![Billing & Usage icon](/img/assets/icons/CreditCard.svg) *Billing & Usage* tab, you can see the current monthly usage of your project compared to the maximum usage allowed by your project's subscription. Use the arrows in the top right corner to see the project's usage for any chosen month.

Note also that if your usage indicates that another subscription plan would fit better for your project, a message will be displayed in the ![Billing & Usage icon](/img/assets/icons/CreditCard.svg) *Billing & Usage* tab to advise which plan you could switch to.
:::

<ThemedImage
  alt="Project billing"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/cloud/settings_billing.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/cloud/settings_billing_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

#### Managing project's number of seats

You can manually add more seats or lower the number of seats for your project without necessarily upgrading or downgrading to another plan (see [full documentation on seats management](/cloud/getting-started/usage-billing#seats-management)).

##### Adding more seats for the project

1. In the ![Billing & Usage icon](/img/assets/icons/CreditCard.svg) *Billing & Usage* tab of your project's settings, click on the **Manage** button next to the displayed number of seats.
2. In the window that opens, select with the drop-down the number of Additional seats of your choice. The cost of the additional seats is automatically calculated and displayed in the window.
3. (optional) Click **I have a discount code**, enter your discount code in the field, and click on the **Apply** button.
4. Click the **Save** button to confirm. You will automatically be billed with the payment method defined in your profile.

##### Removing seats from the project

1. In the ![Billing & Usage icon](/img/assets/icons/CreditCard.svg) *Billing & Usage* tab of your project's settings, click on the **Manage** button next to the displayed number of seats.
2. In the window that opens, select with the drop-down the number of *Billed seats* you want to keep.
3. Click the **Save button** to confirm. The new, lower number of seats will not be effective until the next month.

### Plans

The ![Plans icon](/img/assets/icons/MapTrifold.svg) *Plans* tab displays an overview of the available Strapi Cloud plans and allows you to upgrade or downgrade from your current plan to another.

:::note
If you are using the free trial, the *Plan* tab shows a countdown of how many days you have left, as well as indications of the next steps. For more information about the free trial and project suspension, please refer to [Information on billing & usage](/cloud/getting-started/usage-billing).
:::

<ThemedImage
  alt="Project plans"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/cloud/settings_plans.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/cloud/settings_plans_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

#### Upgrading to another plan

Strapi Cloud plan upgrades to another, higher plan are immediate and can be managed for each project via the project settings.

:::note
When using the free trial, the buttons to upgrade to another plan are greyed out and unusable until you have filled in your billing information. Please refer to [Account billing details](/cloud/account/account-billing) for more information.
:::

To upgrade your current plan to a higher one:

1. In the ![Plans icon](/img/assets/icons/MapTrifold.svg) *Plans* tab of your project's settings, click on the **Upgrade** button of the plan you want to upgrade to.
2. In the window that opens, check the payment details that indicate how much you will have to pay immediately after confirming the upgrade, and the available options.

   a. (optional) Click the **Edit** button to select another payment method.
   b. (optional) Click **I have a discount code**, enter your discount code in the field, and click on the **Apply** button.

3. Click on the **Upgrade to [plan name]** button to confirm the upgrade of your Strapi project to another plan.

#### Downgrading to another plan

Strapi Cloud plan downgrades can be managed for each project via the project settings. Downgrades are however not immediately effective: the higher plan will still remain active until the end of the current month (e.g. if you downgrade from the Team plan to the Pro plan on June 18th, your project will remain on the Team plan until the end of the month: on July 1st, the Pro plan will be effective for the project).

:::caution
Make sure to check the usage of your Strapi Cloud project before downgrading: if your current usage exceeds the limits of the lower plan, you are taking the risk of getting charged for the overages. You may also lose access to some features: for example, downgrading to the Developer plan which doesn't include the Backups feature, would make you lose all your project's backups. Please refer to [Information on billing & usage](/cloud/getting-started/usage-billing) for more information.

Note also that you cannot downgrade if you have additional environments (i.e. extra environments that have been purchased, not the default or included environments). For instance, if you wish to downgrade from the Pro plan to the Developer plan, you first need to delete all additional environments that have been configured (see [Resetting & Deleting environment](#resetting--deleting-environment)), for the **Downgrade** button to be displayed and available again.
:::

To downgrade your current plan to a lower one:

1. In the ![Plans icon](/img/assets/icons/MapTrifold.svg) *Plans* tab of your project's settings, click on the **Downgrade** button of the plan you want to downgrade to.
2. In the window that opens, check the information related to downgrading.
3. Click on the **Downgrade** button to confirm the downgrade of your Strapi project's plan. 

:::tip
Downgrades are effective from the 1st of the following month. Before that date, you can click on the **Cancel downgrade** button to remain on the current plan.
:::

### Invoices

The ![Invoices icon](/img/assets/icons/Invoice.svg) *Invoices* tab displays the full list of invoices for your Strapi Cloud project as well as their status.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Project invoices"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/cloud/settings_invoices.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/cloud/settings_invoices_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

<InvoiceStatus components={props.components} />

:::strapi Invoices are also available in your profile settings.
In the *Profile > Invoices* tab, you will find the complete list of invoices for all your projects. Feel free to check the [dedicated documentation](/cloud/account/account-billing#account-invoices).
:::


## Environment-level settings

In the project's environments' settings, you first need to select the environment whose settings you would like to configure, using the dropdown. Depending on the chosen environment, there are 3 to 4 tabs available:

- ![General icon](/img/assets/icons/Faders.svg) [*General (environment)*](#general),
- ![Backups icon](/img/assets/icons/ArrowClockwise.svg) [*Backups*](#backups), which are only available for the production environment,
- ![Domains icon](/img/assets/icons/Browsers.svg) [*Domains*](#domains),
- and ![Variables icon](/img/assets/icons/code2.svg) [*Variables*](#variables).

### General (environment)

The ![General icon](/img/assets/icons/Faders.svg) *General* tab for the environment-level settings enables you to check and update the following options for the project:

- *Basic information*, to see:
  - the name of your Strapi Cloud project's environment. The environment name is set when it is created and cannot be modified afterwards.
  - the Node version of the environment: to change the Node version of the project (see [Modifying Node version](#modifying-node-version)).
  - the app's internal name for the environment, which can be useful for debug & support purposes.
- *Connect branch*: to change the branch of the GitHub repository used for your environment (see [Editing Git branch](#editing-git-branch)). Also allows to enable/disable the "deploy on push" option.
- *Danger zone*: to reset or permanently delete your Strapi Cloud project's environment (see [Resetting & Deleting environment](#resetting--deleting-environment)).

2. Write in the textbox your *Environment name*.
3. Click on the **Delete environment** button to confirm the deletion.

### Backups <CloudProBadge /> <CloudTeamBadge /> <UpdatedBadge /> {#backups}

The ![Backups icon](/img/assets/icons/ArrowClockwise.svg) *Backups* tab informs you of the status and date of the latest backup of your Strapi Cloud projects. The databases associated with all existing Strapi Cloud projects are indeed automatically backed up (weekly for Pro plans and daily for Team plans). Backups are retained for a 28-day period. Additionally, you can create a single manual backup.

:::note Notes

- The backup feature is not available for Strapi Cloud projects using the free trial or the Developer plan. You will need to upgrade to either the Pro or Team plan to have your project automatically backed up and to have access to manual backups.

<!-- - Only project owners can restore a backup. Maintainers have access to the ![Backups icon](/img/assets/icons/ArrowClockwise.svg) *Backups* tab but the **Restore backup** button won't be displayed for them. Refer to [Collaboration](/cloud/projects/collaboration) for more information. -->

- The manual backup option should become available shortly after project's first succesful deployment.

- The backup feature is only available for the default, production environment. Other additional environment's settings will not show the ![Backups icon](/img/assets/icons/ArrowClockwise.svg) *Backups* tab.
:::

:::tip
For projects created before the release of the Backup feature in October 2023, the first backup will automatically be triggered with the next deployment of the project.
