The **Notification center** is accessible from the top navigation of the Cloud dashboard.

The following notifications can be listed in the Notifications center:

* **Deploy completed**: When a deployment is successfully done.
* **Build failed**: When deployment fails during the build stage.
* **Deploy failed** When it fails during the deployment stage.
* **Deploy triggered** When deployment is triggered by new push to the connected repo. This notificaiton isn't sent when you trigger a deployment manually.

Clicking on a deploy-related notification card redirects you to **Log details** of the corresponding deployment.

All notifications older than 30 days are automatically removed from the **Notification center**.
