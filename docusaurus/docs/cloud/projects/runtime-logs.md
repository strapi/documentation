# Runtime logs

From a chosen project's dashboard, the *Runtime logs* tab displays the live logs of the project.

:::note

- The *Runtime logs* are only accessible once the project is successfully deployed.
- Runtime logs are not live for projects on the Free plan and are reset each time the application is scaled to zero due to inactivity.
