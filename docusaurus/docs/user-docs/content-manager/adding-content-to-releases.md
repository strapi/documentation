# Including content in a release  <EnterpriseBadge /> <CloudTeamBadge />

Using the [Releases](/user-docs/releases/introduction) feature, you can group several entries to publish them altogether. Adding entries to a release is done from the Content Manager. You can also remove an entry from a release while updating the entry.

:::prerequisites
- Before entries can be added to a release, you must create a release from the [Releases](/user-docs/releases/creating-a-release) page.
- Adding content to a release requires the appropriate permissions for the Content-Releases plugin (see [configuring administrator roles](/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-administrator-roles#plugins-and-settings)).

## Adding multiple entries to a release

Multiple entries can be added to a [release](/user-docs/releases/introduction) from the list view of the Content Manager.

To add entries to a release:

1. From the list view of the Content Manager, select which entries you want to add by ticking the box on the left side of the entries' record.
2. Click on the **Add to release** button located above the header of the table.
3. In the modal, select which release to add these entries to.
4. Click on the **Publish** or **Unpublish** button to decide whether these entries will be published or unpublished when the release is published, then click **Continue**.

The *Releases* box on the right should show which release(s) the entry is included in.
