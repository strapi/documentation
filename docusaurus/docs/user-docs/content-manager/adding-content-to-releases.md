# Including content in a release  <EnterpriseBadge /> <CloudTeamBadge /> <FutureBadge /> <AlphaBadge />

Using the [Releases](/user-docs/releases/introduction) feature, you can group several entries to publish them altogether. Adding entries to a release is done from the Content Manager. You can also remove an entry from a release while updating the entry.

:::prerequisites
- Before entries can be added to a release, you must create a release from the [Releases](/user-docs/releases/creating-a-release) page.
- Adding content to a release requires the appropriate permissions for the Content-Releases plugin (see [configuring administrator roles](/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-administrator-roles#plugins-and-settings)).
