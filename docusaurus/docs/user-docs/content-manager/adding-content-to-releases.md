# Including content in a release

Using the [Releases](/user-docs/releases/introduction) feature, you can group several entries to publish them altogether. Adding entries to a release is done from the Content Manager. You can also remove an entry from a release while updating the entry.

<!-- TODO: confirm if we can't create releases on the fly -->
:::prerequisites
Before entries can be added to a release, you must create a release from the [Releases](/user-docs/releases/creating-a-release) page.
