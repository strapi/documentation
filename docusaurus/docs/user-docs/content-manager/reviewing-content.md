# Reviewing content <EnterpriseBadge />

Using the [Review Workflows](/user-docs/settings/review-workflows) feature, you can manage content throughout the content creation process. In the Content Manager, you can change the review stage of the content from the edit view, and keep moving it between stages as needed. You can also change the assignee of the content, assigning it to a Strapi admin user for review.

When viewing your content in the Content Manager, you can see the current stage in the **Review Stage** and the assignee in the **Assignee** column:

  }}
/>

## Change review stage

As content is created and revised among your team, you can change the review stage of the content to any stage defined in the review workflow (see [Managing Review Workflows](/user-docs/settings/review-workflows)).

To change the review stage of your content:

1. Access the edit view of your content-type.
2. In the Information box, click on the _Review stage_ drop-down list.
3. Choose the new review stage of your entry. It is automatically saved.

Entries of a review workflow content type can be assigned to any admin user in Strapi for review.

To change the assignee of your content:

1. Access the edit view of your content-type.
2. In the Information box, click on the _Assignee_ drop-down list.
