# Reviewing content <EnterpriseBadge />

Using the [review workflows](/user-docs/settings/review-workflows) feature, you can manage content throughout the content creation process. In the Content Manager, you can change the review stage of the content from the edit view, and keep moving it between stages as needed.

When viewing your content in the Content Manager, you can see the current stage of any item in the **Review Stage** column:

## Change review stage

As content is created and revised among your team, you can change the review stage of the content to any stage defined in the review workflows (see [Managing review workflows](/user-docs/settings/review-workflows)).

To change the review stage of your content:

1. Access the edit view of your content-type.
2. In the Information box, click on the *Review stage* drop-down list.
3. Choose the new review stage of your entry. It is automatically saved.
