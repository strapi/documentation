# Reviewing content <EnterpriseBadge /> <AlphaBadge />

Using the [review workflows](/user-docs/settings/review-workflows) feature, you can manage content throughout the content creation process. In the Content Manager, you can assign content to a specific stage in the review workflow, and move content between stages as needed.

When viewing your content in the Content Manager, you can see the current status of any item in the **Review Stage** column:

## Assigning content to a review stage

As content is created and revised among your team, you can assign content to a specific stage in the review workflow. When [writing or editing content](/user-docs/content-manager/writing-content), you can assign content to a specific stage in the review workflow by clicking on the **Review Stage** dropdown menu in the **Information** section of the content editor:
