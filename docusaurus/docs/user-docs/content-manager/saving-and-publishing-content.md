# Saving, publishing and deleting content

Strapi allows you to manage your content throughout its whole lifecycle, whether you are working on its draft version, about to finish it and share it with the world, or wanting to delete it when it's obsolete.

## Saving & publishing content

:::caution
The possibility to manage drafts for contents comes from the Draft & Publish feature. This feature is activated by default, but it can be deactivated for any content-type from the Content-type Builder (see [advanced settings for content-types](/user-docs/content-type-builder/managing-content-types#advanced-settings)). If you disabled the Draft & Publish feature, saving your content means saving and publishing at the same time.
:::

Your contents can have 2 statuses: draft or published. You can see the current status indicated on the right of the interface, above the Information box.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/content-manager/editing_draft_version2.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/content-manager/editing_draft_version2_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

By default, each newly created content is a draft. Drafts can be modified and saved at will, using the **Save** button on the top right corner of the edit view, until they are ready to be published.

### Publishing and unpublishing

#### Publishing a draft

To publish a draft, click on the **Publish** button in the top right corner of the content editor.

:::caution
Before publishing a draft, make sure it doesn't have relations with other non-published content, otherwise some of the content may not be available through the API.
:::

When a content is not a draft anymore, but has been published, it is indicated on the right of the interface, above the Information box.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Editing published version"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/content-manager/editing_published_version2.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/content-manager/editing_published_version2_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

:::tip
To schedule publication, i.e. convert a draft to a published entry at a given date and time, you can follow [this technical guide](https://forum.strapi.io/t/schedule-publications/23184) which requires adding custom code to the Strapi application.
:::

#### Unpublishing content

Published contents can be unpublished, switching back to being drafts again.

To unpublish content, click on the **Unpublish** button in the top right corner of the content editor.

### Bulk publishing and unpublishing

Selecting multiple entries from the Content Manager's list view will display additional buttons to publish or unpublish several entries simultaneously. This is what is called "bulk publishing/unpublishing".

:::caution
If the [Internationalization plugin](/user-docs/plugins/strapi-plugins.md#-internationalization-plugin) is installed, the bulk publish/unpublish actions only apply to the currently selected locale.

#### Bulk publishing drafts

To publish several entries at the same time:

1. From the list view of the Content Manager, select your entries to publish by ticking the box on the left side of the entries' record.
2. Click on the **Publish** button located above the header of the table.
3. In the *Publish entries* dialog, check the list of selected entries and their status:

   - ![Success icon](/img/assets/icons/CheckCircle.svg) Ready to publish: the entry can be published
   - ![Fail icon](/img/assets/icons/CrossCircle.svg) "[field name] is required", "[field name] is too short" or "[field name] is too long": the entry cannot be published because of the issue stated in the red warning message.

4. (optional) If some of your entries have a ![Edit icon](/img/assets/icons/CrossCircle.svg) status, click the ![Edit icon](/img/assets/icons/edit.svg) edit buttons to fix the issues until all entries have the ![Success icon](/img/assets/icons/CheckCircle.svg) Ready to publish status. Note that you will have to click on the **Refresh** button to update the *Publish entries* dialog as you fix the various entries issues.
5. Click the **Publish** button.
6. In the confirmation dialog box, confirm your choice by clicking again on the **Publish** button.

#### Bulk unpublishing content

3. In the confirmation dialog box, confirm your choice by clicking again on the **Unpublish** button.

## Deleting content

You can delete content by deleting any entry of a collection type, or the default entry of a single type.

1. In the edit view of the entry, click on the **Delete this entry** button, located at the bottom of the right side of the interface.
2. In the window that pops up, click on the **Confirm** button to confirm the deletion.
