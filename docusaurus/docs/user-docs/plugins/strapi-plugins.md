# List of Strapi plugins

Strapi builds and maintains plugins that extend the functionality of a core Strapi application. This section is a reference guide to the pre-installed plugins and additional plugins developed by Strapi, which are available in the [Marketplace](/user-docs/plugins/installing-plugins-via-marketplace/). Additional documentation on plugins is provided in the relevant sections of the User Guide and the Developer Documentation, however, a brief plugin description, how the installed plugin works, and changes to the admin panel is provided.

:::note

- Some Strapi Starters and Templates might install additional plugins beyond the default plugins listed below.
- If plugin options are only available with an [Enterprise edition license](https://strapi.io/pricing-self-hosted), they are marked with  <EnterpriseBadge /> in this reference guide.
- All plugin installations can be confirmed in ![Cog icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Cog.svg) *Settings > Plugins* in the admin panel.

## Pre-installed plugins

### <img width="28" src="/img/assets/plugins/icon_i18n-plugin.png" /> Internationalization plugin

The Internationalization plugin is installed by default on all v5 Strapi applications, but it can be deactivated.

This plugin is used to manage content in different languages, called "locales". With the Internationalization plugin, it is possible to:

- define which locales should be available in the Strapi application,
- define which content-types and fields can be translated in different locales, or should only be available in the default locale,
- translate content and manage each locale individually.

The Internationalization plugin affects several parts of the admin panel. The table below lists all the additional options and settings that are added to a Strapi application once the plugin has been installed.

### <img width="28" src="/img/assets/plugins/icon_up-plugin.png" /> Users & Permissions plugin

The Users & Permissions plugin is installed by default on all v5 Strapi applications, but can be deactivated.

This plugin is used to manage end users, who consume the content that is created and managed with a Strapi application and displayed on a front-end application (e.g. website, mobile application, connected device, etc.). With the Users & Permissions plugin, it is possible to:

- manage end users accounts, based on the "User" collection type available through the plugin,
- define the available end-user roles and their related permissions,
- manage available providers to enable end users to login through third-party providers,
- configure available email templates aimed at the end users (e.g. password reset, email address confirmation).
