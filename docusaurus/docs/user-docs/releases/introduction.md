Releases is currently only available as an experimental, future flag. See <a href="/dev-docs/configurations/features">future flags</a> documentation for instructions on how to enable a future flag.

Releases enable content managers to group several entries to publish/unpublish them simultanously. Entries can be grouped by content type or locale, facilitating review and editing before publication.

<!-- TODO: annotate screenshots to add numbers -->

<!-- TODO: update Releases icon with the neutral version -->
Administrators can access Releases from ![Releases icon](/img/assets/icons/releases.svg) _Releases_ in the main navigation of the admin panel.

From the Releases view, it is possible to:

<!-- TODO: add numbers to reflect screenshot -->
- [create a new release](/user-docs/releases/creating-a-release)
- view pending and done releases
- click on a release to [manage its content](/user-docs/releases/managing-a-release)

:::info
It's not currently possible to schedule the publication of a release, so releases should be published manually. Automatic scheduling will be added in a future version of Strapi.
