# Releases <EnterpriseBadge /> <CloudTeamBadge/>

Releases enables content managers to organize entries into containers that can perform publish and unpublish actions simultaneously. A release can contain entries from different content types and can mix locales.

<!-- TODO: update Releases icon with the neutral version -->
Administrators can access Releases from ![Releases icon](/img/assets/icons/releases.svg) _Releases_ in the main navigation of the admin panel.

From the Releases view, it is possible to:

<!-- TODO: add numbers to reflect screenshot -->
- [create a new release](/user-docs/releases/creating-a-release)
- view pending and done releases
- click on a release to [manage its content](/user-docs/releases/managing-a-release)

:::info
It's not currently possible to schedule the publication of a release, so releases should be published manually. Automatic scheduling will be added in a future version of Strapi.
