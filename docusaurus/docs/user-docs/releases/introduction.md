# Releases <EnterpriseBadge /> <CloudTeamBadge/>

Releases enables content managers to organize entries into containers that can perform publish and unpublish actions simultaneously. A release can contain entries from different content types and can mix locales.

Administrators can access Releases from ![Releases icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/PaperPlane.svg) _Releases_ in the main navigation of the admin panel.

From the Releases view, it is possible to:

- [create a new release](/user-docs/releases/creating-a-release),
- view pending and done releases,
- view which releases are [scheduled](/user-docs/releases/managing-a-release#scheduling-a-release-), and when they will be published (in the Pending tab) or have been published (in the Done tab),
- and click on a release to [manage its content](/user-docs/releases/managing-a-release).
