# Creating a release

The [Releases](/user-docs/releases/introduction) page allows creating new releases that will be used to group entries.

To create a new release:

1. Click the **+ New release** button in the upper right corner of the Releases page.  
2. Give the release a name.
3. Click the **Continue** button.

Adding entries to a release must be done from the Content Manager:

- You can add multiple entries to a release [from the list view](/user-docs/content-manager/adding-content-to-releases#adding-multiple-entries-to-a-release).
- You can also add a single entry to a release while creating or editing the entry [in the edit view](/user-docs/content-manager/adding-content-to-releases#adding-a-single-entry-to-a-release).
