# Creating a release  <EnterpriseBadge /> <CloudTeamBadge />

The ![Releases icon](/img/assets/icons/releases.svg) [Releases](/user-docs/releases/introduction) page allows creating new releases that will be used to organize entries.

To create a new release:

1. Click the **+ New Release** button in the upper right corner of the Releases page.  
2. Give the release a name.
3. Define the date, time, and timezone to schedule the release (see [scheduling a release](/user-docs/releases/managing-a-release#scheduling-a-release)). Alternatively, uncheck the **Schedule release** checkbox if you do not want to automatically publish the release and release it manually instead.
4. Click the **Continue** button.

Adding entries to a release must be done from the Content Manager. You can add a single entry to a release while creating or editing the entry [in the edit view](/user-docs/content-manager/adding-content-to-releases).

<!-- TODO: for later, when multiple addition is implemented, probably in 4.20 -->
<!-- 
Adding entries to a release must be done from the Content Manager:

- You can add multiple entries to a release [from the list view](/user-docs/content-manager/adding-content-to-releases#adding-multiple-entries-to-a-release).
- You can also add a single entry to a release while creating or editing the entry [in the edit view](/user-docs/content-manager/adding-content-to-releases#adding-a-single-entry-to-a-release). -->
