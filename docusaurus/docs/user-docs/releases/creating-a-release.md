2. Give the release a name.

Adding entries to a release must be done from the Content Manager: You can add a single entry to a release while creating or editing the entry [in the edit view](/user-docs/content-manager/adding-content-to-releases#adding-a-single-entry-to-a-release).

<!-- TODO: for later, when multiple addition is implemented -->
