# Administration panel

The admin panel is the back office of your Strapi application. From the admin panel, you will be able to manage content-types and write their actual content, but also manage users, both administrators and end users of your Strapi application.

## Overview

## Configuration

**Path to configure the admin panel:** Account name or initials (bottom left hand corner) > Profile

If you are a new administrator, we recommend making sure your profile is all set, before diving into your Strapi application. From your administrator profile, you are able to modify your user information (name, username, email, password). You can also choose the language and mode of the interface for your Strapi application.
