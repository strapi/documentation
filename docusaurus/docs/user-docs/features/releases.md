## Configuration

To be able to include your content in releases, and to schedule and publish those releases, you must first create them. You can also delete releases that are obsolete or irrelevant. You can also modify the releases' default timezone to use when scheduling a publication.

### Choosing default timezone

**Path to configure the feature:** ![Settings icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Cog.svg) Settings

1. Click on the _Default timezone_ dropdown list and choose the default timezone to use.
2. Click **Save**.

  }}

### Creating a release

**Path to configure the feature:** ![Releases icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/PaperPlane.svg) Releases

1. Click the ![Plus icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Plus.svg) **New Release** button in the upper right corner.  
2. Give the release a name.
3. (_optional_) If you want to schedule the release publication instead of publishing the release manually, check the **Schedule release** checkbox and define the date, time, and timezone for publication. Scheduling is currently a <FeatureFlagBadge /> feature (see [scheduling a release](/user-docs/releases/managing-a-release#scheduling-a-release) for details).
4. Click the **Continue** button.

:::tip
Your releases can be renamed afterwards, by editing the release using the ![More icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/More.svg) then ![Edit icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Pencil.svg) **Edit** buttons.

2. Select ![Delete icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Trash.svg) **Delete**.

## Usage

**Path to use the feature:** ![Releases icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/PaperPlane.svg) Releases and ![Content icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Feather.svg) Content Manager

:::caution
Since publishing an entry with a release means turning a draft entry into a published entry, Releases will not work if [Draft & Publish](/user-docs/content-manager/saving-and-publishing-content) is disabled for the content-type.
:::

### Including content in a release

:::prerequisites
- Before entries can be added to a release, you must create a release from the ![Releases icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/PaperPlane.svg) Releases page.
- Adding content to a release requires the appropriate permissions for the Content-Releases plugin (see [configuring administrator roles](/user-docs/users-roles-permissions/configuring-administrator-roles#plugins-and-settings)).

2. Select which release to add this entry to.

<!--
:::tip
A release page can display entries either grouped by locale, content-type, or action (publish or unpublish). To change how entries are grouped, click the **Group by â€¦** dropdown and select an option from the list.
:::
-->

### Publishing a release

**Path:** ![Releases icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/PaperPlane.svg) Releases

Publishing a release means that all the actions (publish or unpublish) defined for each entry included in the release will be performed simultaneously. To publish a release, click the **Publish** button in the top right corner of the admin panel.

The _Status_ column displays the status of each entry:

   - ![Success icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/CheckCircle.svg) Already published: the entry is already published and publishing the release will not affect this entry 
   - ![Success icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/CheckCircle.svg) Ready to publish: the entry is ready to  be published with the release
   - ![Fail icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/CrossCircle2.svg) "[field name] is required", "[field name] is too short" or "[field name] is too long": the entry cannot be published because of the issue stated in the red warning message. In this case, the release will be indicated as *Blocked* until all issues have been fixed.
   
If some of your entries have a ![Fail icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/CrossCircle2.svg) status, click the ![More icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/More.svg) and the **Edit the entry** button to fix the issues until all entries have the ![Success icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/CheckCircle.svg) status. Note that you will have to click on the **Refresh** button to update the release page as you fix the various entries issues.

:::caution
Once a release is published, the release itself cannot be updated. You can not re-release that specific release with the same group of entries with some modifications; you must create another release.
