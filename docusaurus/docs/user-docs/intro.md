# Welcome to the Strapi User Guide!

<SubtleCallout title="Developer Docs, User Guide, and Strapi Cloud documentation" emoji="📍">

The documentation for Strapi contains 3 main sections, accessible from the top navigation bar:

- 🧑‍💻 The **[Developer Docs](/dev-docs/intro)** contain all the technical information related to the setup, advanced usage, customization, and update of your Strapi 5 application.
- 🧑‍🏫 The **User Guide** that you're currently reading is all about using Strapi's admin panel.
- ☁️ The **[Strapi Cloud](/cloud/intro)** documentation is about deploying your Strapi application to Strapi Cloud and managing your Strapi Cloud projects and settings.

</SubtleCallout>

This user guide contains the functional documentation related to all features available in the main navigation of your Strapi application.

Once you have logged in, you can access your Strapi admin panel:

    dark: '/img/assets/getting-started/admin-panel-homepage-2_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

The ![Home icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/House.svg) admin panel homepage can display the guided tour (if you have not skipped or completed it yet) and last edited and published entries if you have any.

If you are not sure where to begin on this User Guide, we suggest you to:
