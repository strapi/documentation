# Managing Review Workflows <EnterpriseBadge />

:::info
Review Workflows is an <EnterpriseBadge />-only feature.
:::

The Review Workflows feature allows you to create and manage any desired review stages for your content, enabling your team to collaborate in the content creation flow from draft to publication. Before being available in the [Content Manager](/user-docs/content-manager/reviewing-content) and [Content-Types Builder](/user-docs/content-type-builder), review workflows should be configured from ![Settings icon](/img/assets/icons/settings.svg) *Settings > Global settings > Review Workflows*.

:::note
- The Review workflows settings are only available to users with the Super Admin role by default. Other roles must be granted the **Review workflows** permission. See [Users, Roles, & Permissions](/user-docs/users-roles-permissions) for more information.
- Review Workflows are only available with the Enterprise Edition. If for any reason your project was downgraded to the Community Edition, all review workflows data would not be deleted but kept until the project goes back to Enterprise.
