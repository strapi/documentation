# Releases

The [Releases](/user-docs/releases/introduction) feature enables content managers to organize entries into containers that can perform publish and unpublish actions simultaneously. The default timezone to use when scheduling a publication can be modified from <Icon name="gear-six" /> *Settings > Global settings > Releases*.

<!-- TODO: update screenshots and a dark mode one when I can actually test the feature -->

/>

To modify the default timezone:

1. Go to the *Global settings > Releases* sub-section of the settings interface.
2. Click on the _Default timezone_ dropdown list and choose the default timezone to use.
3. Click **Save**.
