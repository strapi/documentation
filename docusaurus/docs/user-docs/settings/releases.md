# Releases

The [Releases](/user-docs/releases/introduction) feature enables content managers to organize entries into containers that can perform publish and unpublish actions simultaneously. The default timezone to use when scheduling a publication can be modified from ![Settings icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Cog.svg) *Settings > Global settings > Releases*.

<!-- TODO: update screenshots and a dark mode one when I can actually test the feature -->
<ThemedImage
  alt="Release settings"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/releases/release-settings.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/releases/release-settings_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

To modify the default timezone:

1. Go to the *Global settings > Releases* sub-section of the settings interface.
2. Click on the _Default timezone_ dropdown list and choose the default timezone to use.
3. Click **Save**.
