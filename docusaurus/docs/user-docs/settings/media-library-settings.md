# Configuring the Media Library

The [Media Library](/user-docs/media-library) displays all assets uploaded in the Strapi application. The Media Library settings allow controlling the format, file size, and orientation of uploaded assets. Those settings can be configured from ![Settings icon](/img/assets/icons/settings.svg) *Settings > Global settings > Media Library*.
