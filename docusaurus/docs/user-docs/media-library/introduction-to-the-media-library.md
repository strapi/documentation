# Introduction to the Media Library

The Media Library is a Strapi plugin that is always activated by default and cannot be deactivated. It is accessible both when the application is in a development and production environment.

Administrators can access the Media Library from ![ML icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Images.svg) _Media Library_ in the main navigation of the admin panel.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{

    dark: '/img/assets/media-library/media-library_overview_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

The Media Library displays all assets uploaded in the application, either via the Media Library itself or via the Content Manager when managing a media field. Assets uploaded to the Media Library can be inserted into content-types using the [Content Manager](/user-docs/content-manager/writing-content#filling-up-fields).

From the Media Library, it is possible to:

- upload a new asset (see [adding assets](/user-docs/media-library/adding-assets)) or create a new folder (see [organizing assets with folders](/user-docs/media-library/organizing-assets-with-folders)) <ScreenshotNumberReference number="1" />,
- sort the assets and folders or set filters <ScreenshotNumberReference number="2" /> to find assets and folders more easily,
- toggle between the list view ![List icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/List.svg) and the grid view ![Grid icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/GridFour.svg) to display assets, access settings ![Settings icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Cog.svg) to [configure the view](#configuring-the-view), and make a textual search ![Search icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Search.svg) <ScreenshotNumberReference number="3" /> to find a specific asset or folder,
- and view, navigate through, and manage folders <ScreenshotNumberReference number="4" />.

:::tip
Click the search icon ![Search icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Search.svg) on the right side of the user interface to use a text search and find one of your assets or folders more quickly!

## Filtering assets

Right above the list of folders and assets, on the left side of the interface, a ![Filter icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Filter.svg) **Filters** button is displayed. It allows setting one or more condition-based filters, which add to one another (i.e. if you set several conditions, only the assets that match all the conditions will be displayed).

<ThemedImage
  alt="Filters"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/media-library/media-library_filters.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/media-library/media-library_filters_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

To set a new filter:

1. Click on the ![Filter icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Filter.svg) **Filters** button.
2. Click on the 1st drop-down list to choose the field on which the condition will be applied.
3. Click on the 2nd drop-down list to choose the type of condition to apply.
4. For conditions based on the type of asset to filter, click on the 3rd drop-down list and choose a file type to include or exclude. For conditions based on date and time (i.e. _createdAt_ or _updatedAt_ fields), click on the left field to select a date and click on the right field to select a time.
5. Click on the **Add filter** button.

:::note
When active, filters are displayed next to the ![Filter icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Filter.svg) **Filters** button. They can be removed by clicking on the delete icon ![Clear icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Cross.svg).

## Sorting assets

<ThemedImage
  alt="Sort"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/media-library/media-library_sort.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/media-library/media-library_sort_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

Just above the list of folders and assets and next to the ![Filter icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Filter.svg) **Filters** button, on the left side of the interface, a drop-down button is displayed. It allows to sort the assets by upload date, alphabetical order or date of update. Click on the drop-down button and select an option in the list to automatically display the sorted assets.

## Configuring the view

Just above the list of folders and assets, on the right side of the interface, there is a group of 3 buttons. Click on ![Settings icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Cog.svg) to configure the default view for the Media library.

<ThemedImage
  alt="Configure the view"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/media-library/media-library_configure-the-view.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/media-library/media-library_configure-the-view_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

From there you can:

- Use the **Entries per page** dropdown to define the number of assets displayed by default
- Use the **Default sort order** dropdown the define the default order in which assets are displayed. This can be overriden when you [sort assets](#sorting-assets) in the Media Library.

Both settings are used as the defaults in the Media Library and in the [Content Manager media upload modal](/user-docs/content-manager/writing-content#filling-up-fields). The settings saved here are global across the entire Strapi project for all users.
