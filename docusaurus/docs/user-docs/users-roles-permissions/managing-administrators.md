# Managing administrator accounts

Administrators are the users of an admin panel of a Strapi application. Administrator accounts and roles are managed with the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) feature. It is available in the *Administration panel* section of the section of the ![Settings icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Cog.svg) _Settings_ sub navigation.

The *Administration panel* section is divided into 2 sub-sections: *Roles* (see [Configuring administrator roles](configuring-administrator-roles.md)) and *Users*.

  }}
/>

The *Users* sub-section of *Administration panel* displays a table listing all the administrators of your Strapi application.

From this interface, it is possible to:

- make a textual search <ScreenshotNumberReference number="1" /> to find specific administrators,
- set filters <ScreenshotNumberReference number="2" /> to find specific administrators,
- create a new administrator account (see [Creating a new account](#creating-a-new-account)) <ScreenshotNumberReference number="3" />,
- delete an administrator account (see [Deleting an account](#deleting-an-account)),
- or access information regarding an administrator account, and edit it (see [Editing an account](#editing-an-account)).

For each administrator listed in the table, their main account information are displayed, including name, email and attributed role. The status of their account is also indicated: active or inactive, depending on whether the administrator has already logged in to activate the account or not.

:::tip
Sorting can be enabled for most fields displayed in the table. Click on a field name, in the header of the table, to sort on that field.

## Creating a new account

On the top right side of the *Administration panel > Users* interface, a ![Mail icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Mail.svg) **Invite new user** button is displayed. It allows to create a new administrator account for your Strapi application.

To create a new administrator account:
