# Configuring fields for content-types

:::note Development-only
The Content-type Builder is only accessible to create and update content-types when your Strapi application is in a development environment, else it will be in a read-only mode in other environments.
:::

Content-types are composed of one or several fields. Each field is designed to contain specific kind of data, filled up in the Content Manager (see [Writing content](#)).

In the Content-type Builder, fields can be added at the creation of a new content-type or component, or afterward when a content-type or component is edited or updated. The following documentation lists all existing regular fields but also tackles the specificities of components and dynamic zones. For each, you will find a definition, explanation of the form they take once in the Content Manager, and instructions to configure them.

:::note
Depending on what content-type or component is being created or edited, not all fields -including components and dynamic zones- are always available.

1. Click on the 2nd grey box to define the content-type B. It must be an already created collection type.
2. Click on the icon representing the relation to establish between the content-types.
3. Choose the *Field name* of the content-type A, meaning the name that will be used for the field in the content-type A.
4. (optional if disabled by the relation type) Choose the *Field name* of the content-type B.

## Custom fields

Custom fields are a way to extend Strapi’s capabilities by adding new types of fields to content-types or components. Once installed (see [Marketplace](/user-docs/plugins/installing-plugins-via-marketplace.md) documentation), custom fields are listed in the _Custom_ tab when selecting a field for a content-type.

Each custom field type can have basic and advanced settings. The [Marketplace](https://market.strapi.io/plugins?categories=Custom+fields) lists available custom fields, and hosts dedicated documentation for each custom field, including specific settings.

## <img width="28" src="/img/assets/icons/ctb_component.svg" /> Components

Components are a combination of several fields. Components allow to create reusable sets of fields, that can be quickly added to content-types, dynamic zones but also nested into other components.

When configuring a component through the Content-type Builder, it is possible to either:

- create a new component by clicking on *Create a new component* (see [Creating a new component](/user-docs/content-type-builder/creating-new-content-type#creating-a-new-component)),
- or use an existing one by clicking on *Use an existing component*.

After configuring the settings of the dynamic zone, its components must be configured as well. It is possible to either choose an existing component or create a new one.

:::caution
When using dynamic zones, different components cannot have the same field name with different types (or with enumeration fields, different values).
