# Adding assets

The Media Library displays all assets uploaded in the application, either via the [Media Library](/cms/media-library) or the [Content Manager](/cms/content-manager/writing-content.md#filling-up-fields) when managing a media field.

To add new assets to the media library:

1. Click the **Add new assets** button in the upper right corner of the Media Library.
2. Choose whether you want to upload the new asset from your computer or from an URL:
    - from the computer, either drag & drop the asset directly or browse files on your system,
    - from an URL, type or copy and paste an URL(s) in the _URL_ field, making sure multiple URLs are separated by carriage returns, then click **Next**.
3. (optional) Click the edit button ![Edit icon](/img/assets/icons/v5/Pencil.svg) to view asset metadata and define a _File name_, _Alternative text_ and a _Caption_ for the asset (see [editing and deleting assets](managing-assets.md)).
4. (optional) Add more assets by clicking **Add new assets** and going back to step 2.
5. Click on **Upload assets to the library**.

A variety of media types and extensions are supported by the Media Library:
