# Strapi APIs to access your content

Once you've created and configured a Strapi project, created a content structure with the [Content-Type Builder](/cms/features/content-type-builder) and started adding data through the [Content Manager](/cms/features/content-manager), you likely would like to access your content.

From a front-end application, your content can be accessed through Strapi's Content API, which is exposed:
- by default through the [REST API](/cms/api/rest)
- and also through the [GraphQL API](/cms/api/graphql) if you installed the Strapi built-in [GraphQL plugin](/cms/plugins/graphql).

You can also use the [Strapi Client](/cms/api/client) library to interact with the REST API.

REST and GraphQL APIs represent the top-level layers of the Content API exposed to external applications. Strapi also provides 2 lower-level APIs:

- The [Document Service API](/cms/api/document-service) is the recommended API to interact with your application's database within the [backend server](/cms/customization) or through [plugins](/cms/plugins-development/developing-plugins). The Document Service is the layer that handles **documents** <DocumentDefinition /> as well as Strapi's complex content structures like components and dynamic zones.
- The Query Engine API interacts with the database layer at a lower level and is used under the hood to execute database queries. It gives unrestricted internal access to the database layer, but is not aware of any advanced Strapi features that Strapi 5 can handle, like Draft & Publish, Internationalization, Content History, and more.<br/>‚ö†Ô∏è In most, if not all, use cases, you should use the Document Service API instead.
