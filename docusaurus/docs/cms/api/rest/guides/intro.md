# REST API Guides

The [REST API reference](/cms/api/rest) documentation is meant to provide a quick reference for all the endpoints and parameters available.

## Guides

The following guides, officially maintained by the Strapi Documentation team, cover dedicated topics and provide detailed explanations (guides indicated with 🧠) or step-by-step instructions (guides indicated with 🛠️) for some use cases:
