# Content-type Builder

From the <Icon name="layout" /> Content-type Builder, accessible via the main navigation of the admin panel, users can create and edit their content types.

<IdentityCard>
  <IdentityCardItem icon="user" title="Role & permission">Minimum "Read" permission in Roles > Plugins - Content Type Builder.</IdentityCardItem>
  <IdentityCardItem icon="desktop" title="Environment">Available in Development environment only.</IdentityCardItem>
</IdentityCard>

## Overview

<Guideflow lightId="lpnm3w1ber" darkId="zklmd4gijr" />

The <Icon name="layout" /> Content-type Builder allows the creation and management of content-types, which can be:

- Collection types: content-types that can manage several entries.
- Single types: content-types that can only manage one entry.
- Components: content structure that can be used in multiple collection types and single types. Although they are technically not proper content-types because they cannot exist independently, components are also created and managed through the Content-type Builder, in the same way as collection and single types.

All 3 are displayed as categories in the sub navigation of the <Icon name="layout" /> Content-type Builder. In each category are listed all content-types and components that have already been created.

:::tip
Click the search icon <Icon name="magnifying-glass" classes="ph-bold" /> in the <Icon name="layout" /> Content-type Builder sub navigation to find a specific collection type, single type, or component.
:::

In the Content-type Builder's sub navigation is also displayed a centralised **Save** button that applies for all content-types and components. Along with the display of statuses for both content-types/components and fields, this allows you to work on several content-types and components at the same time. The following statuses can be displayed:

- `New` or `N` indicates that a content-type/component or field is new and hasn't been saved yet,
- `Modified` or `M` indicates that a content-type/component or field has been modified since the last save,
- `Deleted` or `D` indicates that a content-type/component or field has been deleted but that it will only be confirmed once saved.

:::note
Clicking on the **...** button next to **Save** gives access to other options, such as **Undo/Redo last change** and **Discard all changes**. These options are also centralised, meaning that they apply to the last action(s) that was/were done on all content-types, components and fields since the last time you saved.
:::

## Usage

<br/>

### Creating content-types

The Content-type Builder allows to create new content-types: single and collection types, but also components.

#### New content-type

<ThemedImage
  alt="Content-type creation"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/content-type-builder/content-type-creation.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/content-type-builder/content-type-creation_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

1. Choose whether you want to create a collection type or a single type.
2. In the <Icon name="layout" /> Content-type Builder's category of the content-type you want to create, click on **Create new collection/single type**.
3. In the content-type creation window, write the name of the new content-type in the *Display name* textbox.
4. Check the *API ID* to make sure the automatically pre-filled values are correct. Collection type names are indeed automatically pluralized when displayed in the Content Manager. It is recommended to opt for singular names, but the *API ID* field allows to fix any pluralization mistake.
5. (optional) In the Advanced Settings tab, configure the available settings for the new content-type:
      | Setting name    | Instructions                                                                                                                                     |
      |-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
      | Draft & publish | Tick the checkbox to allow entries of the content-type to be managed as draft versions, before they are published (see [Draft & Publish](/cms/features/draft-and-publish)). |
      | Internationalization | Tick the checkbox to allow entries of the content-type to be translated into other locales. |
6. Click on the **Continue** button.
7. Add and configure chosen fields for your content-type (see [Configuring fields for content-types](#configuring-fields-content-type)).
8. Click on the **Save** button.

:::caution
New content-types are only considered created once they have been saved. Saving is only possible if at least one field has been added and properly configured. If these steps have not been done, a content-type cannot be created, listed in its category in the Content-type Builder, and cannot be used in the [Content Manager](/cms/features/content-manager).
:::

#### New component

<ThemedImage
  alt="Component creation"
  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/content-type-builder/component-creation-1.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/content-type-builder/component-creation-1_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

1. In the Components category of the <Icon name="layout" /> Content-type Builder sub navigation, click on **Create new component**.
2. In the component creation window, configure the base settings of the new component:
   - Write the name of the component in the *Display name* textbox.
   - Select an available category, or enter in the textbox a new category name to create one.
   - _(optional)_ Choose an icon representing the new component. You can use the search <Icon name="magnifying-glass" classes="ph-bold" /> to find an icon instead of scrolling through the list.
3. Click on the **Continue** button.
4. Add and configure chosen fields for your component (see [Configuring fields for content-types](#configuring-fields-content-type)).
5. Click on the **Save** button.

### Editing content-types

The Content-type Builder allows to manage all existing content-types. For an chosen content-type or component to edit, the right side of the Content-type Builder interface displays all available editing and management options.

<ThemedImage

  sources={{
    light: '/img/assets/content-type-builder/new_CTB.png',
    dark: '/img/assets/content-type-builder/new_CTB_DARK.png',
  }}
/>

#### Settings

1. Click on the <Icon name="pencil-simple" /> **Edit** button of your content-type to access its settings.
2. Edit the available settings of your choice:

  <Tabs groupId="CTSettings">

  <TabItem value="CTBasicSettings" label="Basic settings">

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Content-type Builder's basic settings"
    sources={{
      light: '/img/assets/content-type-builder/basic-settings.png',
      dark: '/img/assets/content-type-builder/basic-settings_DARK.png',
    }}
  />

  * **Display name**: Name of the content-type or component as it will be displayed in the admin panel.
  * **API ID (singular)**: Name of the content-type or component as it will be used in the API. It is automatically generated from the display name, but can be edited.
  * **API ID (plural)**: Plural name of the content-type or component as it will be used in the API. It is automatically generated from the display name, but can be edited.
  * **Type**: Type of the content-type or component. It can be either a **Collection type** or a **Single type**.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem value="CTAdvancedSettings" label="Advanced settings">

  <ThemedImage
    alt="Content-type Builder's advanced settings"
    sources={{
      light: '/img/assets/content-type-builder/advanced-settings.png',
      dark: '/img/assets/content-type-builder/advanced-settings_DARK.png',
    }}
  />

  * **Draft & Publish**: Enable the [Draft & Publish](/cms/features/draft-and-publish) feature for the content-type or component. It is disabled by default.
  * **Internationalization**: Enable the [Internationalization](/cms/features/internationalization) feature for the content-type or component. It is disabled by default.

  </TabItem>

  </Tabs>
3. Click the **Finish** button in the dialog.
4. Click the **Save** button in the Content-Type Builder navigation.

#### Fields

From the table that lists the fields of your content-type, you can:
- Click on the <Icon name="pencil-simple" /> button to access a field's basic and advanced settings to edit them
- Click on the **Add another field** buttons to create a new field for the selected content-type
- Click on the <Icon name="dots-six-vertical" classes="ph-bold"/> button and drag and drop any field to reorder the content-type's fields
- Click on the <Icon name="trash" /> button to delete a field

:::caution
Editing a field allows renaming it. However, keep in mind that regarding the database, renaming a field means creating a whole new field and deleting the former one. Although nothing is deleted from the database, the data that was associated with the former field name will not be accessible from the admin panel of your application anymore.
:::

### Configuring content-types fields {#configuring-fields-content-type}

Content-types are composed of one or several fields. Each field is designed to contain specific kind of data, filled up in the Content Manager (see [Creating & Writing content](/cms/features/content-manager#creating--writing-content)).

In the <Icon name="layout" /> Content-type Builder, fields can be added at the creation of a new content-type or component, or afterward when a content-type or component is edited or updated.

:::note
Depending on what content-type or component is being created or edited, not all fields -including components and dynamic zones- are always available.

#### <img width="28" src="/img/assets/icons/v5/ctb_component.svg" /> Components {#components}

Components are a combination of several fields. Components allow to create reusable sets of fields, that can be quickly added to content-types, dynamic zones but also nested into other components.

When configuring a component through the Content-type Builder, it is possible to either:

- create a new component by clicking on *Create a new component* (see [Creating a new component](#new-component)),
- or use an existing one by clicking on *Use an existing component*.

#### <img width="28" src="/img/assets/icons/v5/ctb_dz.svg" /> Dynamic zones {#dynamiczones}

Dynamic zones are a combination of components that can be added to content-types. They allow a flexible content structure as once in the Content Manager, administrators have the choice of composing and rearranging the components of the dynamic zone how they want.

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="base" label="Base settings">

| Enable localization for this field | (if [Internationalization](/cms/features/internationalization) is enabled for the content-type) Allow the dynamic zone to be translated per available locale. |

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

After configuring the settings of the dynamic zone, its components must be configured as well. It is possible to either choose an existing component or create a new one.

:::caution
When using dynamic zones, different components cannot have the same field name with different types (or with enumeration fields, different values).
:::

#### Custom fields

[Custom fields](/cms/features/custom-fields) are a way to extend Strapi’s capabilities by adding new types of fields to content-types or components. Once installed (see [Marketplace](/cms/plugins/installing-plugins-via-marketplace) documentation), custom fields are listed in the _Custom_ tab when selecting a field for a content-type.

Each custom field type can have basic and advanced settings. The <ExternalLink to="https://market.strapi.io/plugins?categories=Custom+fields" text="Marketplace"/> lists available custom fields, and hosts dedicated documentation for each custom field, including specific settings.

### Deleting content-types

Content types and components can be deleted through the Content-type Builder. Deleting a content-type automatically deletes all entries from the Content Manager that were based on that content-type. The same goes for the deletion of a component, which is automatically deleted from every content-type or entry where it was used.

1. In the <Icon name="layout" /> Content-type Builder sub navigation, click on the name of the content-type or component to delete.
2. In the edition interface of the chosen content-type or component, click on the <Icon name="pencil-simple" /> **Edit** button on the right side of the content-type's or component's name.
3. In the edition window, click on the **Delete** button.
4. In the confirmation window, confirm the deletion.
5. Click on the **Save** button in the Content-type Builder sub navigation.

:::caution
Deleting a content-type only deletes what was created and available from the Content-type Builder, and by extent from the admin panel of your Strapi application. All the data that was created based on that content-type is however kept in the database. For more information, please refer to the related <ExternalLink to="https://github.com/strapi/strapi/issues/1114" text="GitHub issue"/>.
