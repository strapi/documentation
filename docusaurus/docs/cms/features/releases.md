# Releases
<GrowthBadge/>

The Releases feature enables content managers to organize entries into containers that can perform publish and unpublish actions simultaneously. A release can contain entries from different content types and can mix locales.

## Configuration

To be able to include your content in releases, and to schedule and publish those releases, you must first create them. You can also modify the releases' default timezone to use when scheduling a publication, as well as deleting releases that are obsolete or irrelevant.

### Choosing default timezone

**Path to configure the feature:** <Icon name="gear-six" /> Settings

1. Click on the _Default timezone_ dropdown list and choose the default timezone to use.
2. Click **Save**.

### Creating a release

**Path to configure the feature:** <Icon name="paper-plane-tilt" /> Releases

1. Click the <Icon name="plus" classes="ph-bold" /> **New Release** button in the upper right corner.  
2. Give the release a name.
3. (_optional_) If you want to schedule the release publication instead of publishing the release manually, check the **Schedule release** checkbox and define the date, time, and timezone for publication.

### Renaming a release

You can rename a release. To do so, while on a release page:

1. Click on the <Icon name="dots-three-outline" /> button in the top right corner of the admin panel.
2. Select <Icon name="pencil-simple" /> **Edit**.
3. In the modal, change the name of the release in the _Name_ field.
4. Click **Continue** to save the change.-->

### Deleting a release

**Path:** <Icon name="paper-plane-tilt" /> Releases

Deleting a release will only delete the release itself, but not the content-type entries included in the release.

1. Click on the <Icon name="dots-three-outline" /> button in the top right corner of the admin panel.
2. Select <Icon name="trash" /> **Delete**.
3. In the confirmation dialog, click <Icon name="trash" /> **Confirm**.

## Usage

**Path to use the feature:** <Icon name="paper-plane-tilt" /> Releases and <Icon name="feather" /> Content Manager

:::caution
Since publishing an entry with a release means turning a draft entry into a published entry, Releases will not work if [Draft & Publish](/cms/features/draft-and-publish) is disabled for the content-type.
:::

### Including content in a release

:::prerequisites
- Before entries can be added to a release, you must create a release from the <Icon name="paper-plane-tilt" /> Releases page.
- Adding content to a release requires the appropriate permissions for the Content-Releases plugin (see [configuring administrator roles](/cms/features/users-permissions)).
:::

#### One entry at a time

**Path:** Edit view of the <Icon name="feather" /> Content Manager

1. Click on <Icon name="dots-three-outline" /> in the _Entry_ area on the right side of the interface.
2. In the list, click on the <Icon name="paper-plane-tilt" /> **Add to release** button.
2. Select which release to add this entry to.
3. Click on the **Publish** or **Unpublish** button depending on whether you want the entry to be published or unpublished when the release itself is published, then click **Continue**.

The *Releases* box on the right should show which release(s) the entry is included in.

### Scheduling a release

**Path:** <Icon name="paper-plane-tilt" /> Releases

Releases can be [published manually](#publishing-a-release) or scheduled to be automatically published at a given date and time, with the timezone of your choice.

- or once the release is already created, by editing it.

To schedule an existing release, while on a release page:
1. Click on the <Icon name="dots-three-outline" /> button in the top right corner of the admin panel.

<!--
:::tip
A release page can display entries either grouped by locale, content-type, or action (publish or unpublish). To change how entries are grouped, click the **Group by â€¦** dropdown and select an option from the list.
:::
-->

### Publishing a release

**Path:** <Icon name="paper-plane-tilt" /> Releases

Publishing a release means that all the actions (publish or unpublish) defined for each entry included in the release will be performed simultaneously. To publish a release, click the **Publish** button in the top right corner of the admin panel.

The _Status_ column displays the status of each entry:

   - <Icon name="check-circle" color="rgb(58,115,66)"/> Already published: the entry is already published and publishing the release will not affect this entry 
   - <Icon name="check-circle" color="rgb(58,115,66)"/> Already unpublished: the entry is already unpublished, and publishing the release will not affect this entry.
   - <Icon name="check-circle" color="rgb(58,115,66)"/> Ready to publish: the entry is ready to  be published with the release
   - <Icon name="check-circle" color="rgb(58,115,66)"/> Ready to unpublish: the entry is ready to  be unpublished with the release
   - <Icon name="x-circle" color="rgb(190,51,33)" /> Not ready to publish: the entry cannot be published because some fields are incorrectly filled, or it hasn't reached the required stage for publishing. In this case, the release will be indicated as *Blocked* until all issues have been fixed.

If some of your entries have a <Icon name="x-circle" color="rgb(190,51,33)" /> status, click the <Icon name="dots-three-outline" /> and the **Edit the entry** button to fix the issues until all entries have the <Icon name="check-circle" color="rgb(58,115,66)"/> status. Note that you will have to click on the **Refresh** button to update the release page as you fix the various entries issues.

:::caution
Once a release is published, the release itself cannot be updated. You can not re-release that specific release with the same group of entries with some modifications; you must create another release.
