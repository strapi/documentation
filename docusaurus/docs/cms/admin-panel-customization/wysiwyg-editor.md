# Change the default rich text editor

Strapi's [admin panel](/cms/admin-panel-customization) comes with a built-in rich text editor. To change the default editor, several options are at your disposal:

- You can install a third-party plugin, such as one for CKEditor, by visiting <ExternalLink to="https://market.strapi.io/" text="Strapi's Marketplace"/>.
- You can create your own plugin to create and register a fully custom WYSIWYG field (see [custom fields documentation](/cms/features/custom-fields)).
