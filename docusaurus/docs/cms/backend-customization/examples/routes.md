# Examples cookbook: Custom routes

<NotV5/>

:::prerequisites
This page is part of the back end customization examples cookbook. Please ensure you've read its [introduction](/cms/backend-customization/examples).
:::

**üí≠ Context:**

Out of the box, <ExternalLink to="https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor" text="FoodAdvisor"/> does not control access to its content-type endpoints.

Let's say we [previously created a policy](/cms/backend-customization/examples/policies) to restrict access to the "Reviews" content-type to some conditions, for instance to prevent a restaurant's owner to create a review for their restaurants. We must now enable the policy on the route we use to create reviews.

<SideBySideColumn>

**üéØ Goals**:

- Explicitly define a routes configuration for the "Reviews" content-type.
- Configure the route used when creating a review to:
  - bypass the default Strapi authentication system
  - and restrict access depending on the [previously defined custom policy](/cms/backend-customization/examples/policies).

Additional information can be found in the [Policies](/cms/backend-customization/policies) and [Routes](/cms/backend-customization/routes) documentation.

**üßë‚Äçüíª Code example:**

In the `/api` folder of the <ExternalLink to="https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor" text="FoodAdvisor"/> project, replace the content of the `api/src/api/review/routes/review.js` file with the following code:

```jsx title="src/api/review/routes/review.js"

'use strict';

const { createCoreRouter } = require('@strapi/strapi').factories;

module.exports = createCoreRouter('api::review.review', {
  config: {
    create: {
      auth: false, // set the route to bypass the normal Strapi authentication system
      policies: ['is-owner-review'], // set the route to use a custom policy
      middlewares: [],
    },
  },
});
```
