# Backend customization: An examples cookbook using FoodAdvisor

<NotV5/>

The present section of the documentation is intended for developers who would like to get a deeper understanding of the Strapi back end customization possibilities.

The section is a collection of examples that demonstrate how the core components of the back-end server of Strapi can be used in a real-world project. Front-end code that interacts with the back end may also be part of some examples, but displayed in collapsed blocks by default since front-end code examples are not the main focus of this cookbook.

Examples are meant to extend the features of <ExternalLink to="https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor" text="FoodAdvisor"/>, the official Strapi demo application. FoodAdvisor builds a ready-made restaurants directory powered by a Strapi back end (included in the `/api` folder) and renders a <ExternalLink to="https://nextjs.org/" text="Next.js"/>-powered front-end website (included in the `/client` folder).

:::prerequisites
- ðŸ‘€ You have read the [Quick Start Guide](/cms/quick-start) and/or understood that Strapi is a **headless CMS** <Annotation>A headless CMS is a Content Management System that separates the presentation layer (i.e., the front end, where content is displayed) from the back end (where content is managed).<br /><br/>Strapi is a headless CMS that provides:<ul><li>a back-end server exposing an API for your content,</li><li>and a graphical user interface, called the admin panel, to manage the content.</li></ul>The presentation layer should be handled by another framework, not by Strapi.</Annotation> that helps you create a content structure with the [Content-Type Builder](/cms/features/content-type-builder) and add some content through the [Content Manager](/cms/features/content-manager), then exposes the content through APIs.
- ðŸ‘€ You have read the [back-end customization introduction](/cms/backend-customization) to get a general understanding of what routes, policies, middlewares, controllers, and services are in Strapi.
- ðŸ‘· If you want to test and play with the code examples by yourself, ensure you have cloned the <ExternalLink to="https://github.com/strapi/foodadvisor" text="FoodAdvisor"/> repository, setup the project, and started both the front-end and back-end servers. The Strapi admin panel should be accessible from <ExternalLink to="http://localhost:1337/admin" text="`localhost:1337/admin`"/> and the Next.js-based FoodAdvisor front-end website should be running on <ExternalLink to="http://localhost:3000" text="`localhost:3000`"/>.
