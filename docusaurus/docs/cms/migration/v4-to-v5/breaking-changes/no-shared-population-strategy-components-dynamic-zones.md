# Components and dynamic zones should be populated using the detailed population strategy (`on` fragments)

In Strapi 5, components and dynamic zones should be populated using the detailed population strategy, with `on` fragments. The shared population strategy possible in Strapi v4 is no longer supported.

**In Strapi v4**

## Migration

### Notes

Additional information on population is available in the [REST API documentation](/cms/api/rest/populate-select#population).

### Manual procedure

Users should ensure that components and dynamic zones are explicitly populated using `on` fragments, such as in the following example syntax and URL:

- example generic syntax:
  
    `populate[dynamic-zone-name][on][component-category.component-name]=true`

- example URL:

  `/api/articles?populate[dynamic-zone-name][on][component-category.component-name]=true`
