#  Server proxy configurations are grouped under the `server.proxy` object

In Strapi 5, all proxy configuration options are now configured through the `server.proxy` object in `/config/server.js|ts`, whether they are for requests made within `strapi.fetch` or for the global proxy agent for the <ExternalLink to="https://koajs.com/" text="koa"/> server.

## Migration

<MigrationIntro />

### Notes

Additional information about how the `server.proxy` configuration works in Strapi 5 is available in the [server configuration](/cms/configurations/server) documentation.

### Manual migration

Users will need to manually update the code:

- If `server.proxy` is used, it needs to move to `server.proxy.koa`.

- If `server.globalProxy` is used, you have 2 choices:

  - move it to `server.proxy.global` and be aware that it will now work for HTTP/HTTPS requests in addition to `strapi.fetch` requests,
  - or move it to `server.proxy.fetch` to keep the exact same functionality as in Strapi v4, where only fetch was proxied.
