## Migration

<MigrationIntro />

### Notes

* Strapi 5 uses the `mysql2` package for SQLite databases under the hood and rewrites the `mysql` option as `mysql2` for Knex.
* Additional information about database clients and configuration can be found in the [database configuration](/cms/configurations/database) documentation.
* Please also consider that MySQL v8 is the minimum required version for Strapi 5 (see the [related breaking change entry](/cms/migration/v4-to-v5/breaking-changes/mysql5-unsupported)).

### Manual procedure

No manual migration should be required as codemods from the [upgrade tool](/cms/upgrade-tool) will handle this change.
