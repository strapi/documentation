# Configuration

The configuration of a Strapi project lives in the `/config` folder:

<ProjectStructureConfigFiles />

<em style={{fontSize: '12px'}}>The block above is an excerpt from the project structure. You can click on any file name in purple to read the corresponding documentation. Visit the <a href="/cms/project-structure">project structure page</a> for the full version.</em>
